        "Content": "MEXICO CITY  Cliff divers, all-night discos, towering hotels on the sand  that is one side of Acapulco. But a four-hour gun battle over the weekend between soldiers and suspected drug traffickers made clear that the popular beach resort has a dark side and that no part of Mexico may be completely immune from the continuing drug war.\nThe seaside shootout left 13 of the suspected drug traffickers, two of the soldiers and two bystanders  a father and son  dead, the authorities said on Monday. The scene was warlike, with the armed men who were believed to have belonged to the Beltrn Leyva cartel lobbing dozens of grenades at the advancing soldiers and exchanging thousands of rounds with them. \nWith local residents and budget-minded tourists huddling on the ground for cover and shielding their ears from the explosions with their hands, the scene was like something out of Rambo, a witness told the newspaper Reforma.\nBeginning about 8 p.m. Saturday and stretching past midnight, the street battle shut down the old hotel zone, where celebrities such as John Wayne and Elizabeth Taylor used to vacation decades ago, before the area lost its grandeur and newer hotels went up miles farther south on Acapulco Bay. \nAfter the shooting stopped, soldiers recovered a huge cache of weaponry  49 guns, two rocket launchers, 13 grenades and 3,525 bullets of various calibers, the army said. Handcuffed and shirtless inside the drug hide-out were four men who said they were Guerrero State police officers who had been kidnapped. The army said it was investigating the claim.\nOn Monday, gunmen shot and killed two officers near a police station in Acapulco, shortly before other attackers wounded two more officers at another post nearby, according to local news reports. The outbreak of violence was a nightmare for tourism officials struggling to attract visitors scared off by Mexicos often-bloody drug war as well as its recent bout with swine flu. Their pitch has long been that Mexicos violence is centered at the border and in other dicey areas hundreds of miles from where most tourists go.\n That was not the case over the weekend. Acapulcos famous cliff divers are about a mile from the scene of the shootout, and some small budget hotels as well as Acapulcos bullfighting arena are even closer.\n Ive never been so close to something like this, Vincent OHara, 53, a Canadian tourist who visits Acapulco regularly, told local reporters. He and his wife were packing their bags and cutting their vacation short.\nNeighbors living near the hilltop house that the traffickers used as a hide-out told local reporters that they had noticed suspicious activity in the area for months but feared notifying the authorities. Still, the army said it was an anonymous tip that led them to the house.\nThree different drug organizations are struggling for control in the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. The army said Monday that one of the men killed in the shootout was believed to have been a leader of the Beltrn Leyva cartel, which is considered one of Mexicos most dangerous drug groups. Also operating in the area are Los Zetas, a group of former Mexican soldiers, and La Familia, which sometimes portrays itself as a defender of rural families but is known for its ruthless acts, the authorities said.\nIts incredible to come here seeking tranquillity, some rest, and then face something like this, said Amando Zermeo, 45, a Mexican who was vacationing with his wife and two daughters.\nIt was like we were at war, said a housewife who described the floor of her house shaking from the explosions as she prayed to the Virgin of Guadalupe. Identifying herself only by her first name, Gloria, she told local reporters that she lived about 150 feet from the house that was under siege, on a street called Oasis.",

        "Topic": "1989: The Tiananmen Square protests in China",
        "Title": "Chinese Students, in About-Face, Will Continue Occupying Square - The New York Times",
        "Content": "Reversing their earlier position, thousands of university students resolved on Monday to maintain pressure on the Government by continuing their round-the-clock occupation of Tiananmen Square for at least three more weeks.\nIn an emotional scene at the square in the heart of Beijing late Monday night, a crowd of nearly 100,000 workers and students cheered the arrival of a 27-foot sculpture modeled after the Statue of Liberty. The statue, made by local art students and dragged to the square in several pieces on tricycle carts, was called the Goddess of Democracy and Freedom, to distinguish it from the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.\nThe exuberance was a reminder of some of the students' past triumphs in rallying large numbers of people around the nation to support their demands for a more democratic system and less corruption. In recent days, the movement seems to have slumped from a combination of weariness and uncertainty about how to respond to the rise of a hard-line faction in power struggles within the Communist Party leadership. New Mood of Defiance\nWith the number of students occupying the square slipping steadily, student leaders on Saturday had called for a retreat to the university campuses. But on Monday, displaying a new mood of defiance, most of the students remaining on the square declared that to leave would be an admission of defeat. They resolved to stay at least until a meeting of the standing committee of the National People's Congress on June 20.\nThe tens of thousands of students occupying Tiananmen Square at the height of the demonstrations has dwindled to fewer than 10,000, and the lack of garbage collection has left it increasingly dirty and foul smelling. Most Beijing area students have already left, so that those remaining are from other parts of China. The students' occupation of the square is in its third week.\nThe decision to remain in the square, and the arrival of the statue, seemed to raise the protesters' spirits and create a new sense of the possibilities of the movement.\n''She signifies hope for China,'' said Y. H. Yang, a 22-year-old teacher who was in the crowd. ''But she's behind schedule in reaching the square, and she's coming by tricycle. That is symbolic of the slowness and backwardness of the democratization process in China.'' Public Relations Coup Seen\nIt was not clear how the Government would react to makeshift monument, one that dominates the eye of anyone traveling along the capital's main east-west thoroughfare, the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Officials will probably be tempted to take it away, but the students say that the only way to dismantle it would be to smash it. The statue is made of plaster and plastic foam.\nThe students regard the statue as a public relations coup: either it will remain and symbolize the democracy movement and official weakness; or the authorities will be in the embarrassing position of sending the police to attack the Goddess of Democracy and Freedom with sledgehammers.\nBy naming the statue a goddess, the students win a little extra cachet for their creation. Chinese folk beliefs include a pantheon of gods, from the Kitchen God to the God of Fishermen. Goddess With Caucasian Face\nOn the other hand, the Goddess closely resembles the Statue of Liberty, to the point of having Caucasian features and a large Western nose. A few spectators said they thought it might have been more appropriate for her to have Chinese features, but nobody seemed too concerned about such particulars.\n''We don't care if she resembles Westerners or Chinese,'' said T. X. Wang, a 29-year-old factory worker. ''The most important thing is that she symbolizes our common hopes for democracy.''\nPerhaps because many of the fainter-hearted students already have left, the mood on Tiananmen Square now is markedly more resolute than just a few days ago. The students have cleaned up the square to some extent, and they insisted that they would remain indefinitely.\n''Tiananmen Square has become a symbol of democracy in China,'' said Chen Di, a 23-year-old student from Shenyang. ''We can't abandon it.'' Arrivals and Departures\nMr. Chen's classmate Liu Gang interjected: ''If we left, the student movement would certainly lose. And if we stay, the Government will be forced to make a choice. Either it will agree to a dialogue with students, or it will stage a crackdown. And if it chooses the crackdown, it will lose support.''\nMost of the students acknowledge that most of the students will drift away in the coming days and weeks, but some say that new ones will come and take their places. Each day hundreds of new students arrive to join the sit-in at Tiananmen Square, but for now even larger numbers are leaving the capital each day.\nAs the movement's momentum has waned, local residents who had heaped food and blankets on the demonstrators seemed to be cutting back on their material support. Still, offerings of sustenance continued.\n''The students are patriotic, and we must support them,'' said Xue Yuhai, a 74-year-old fruit seller who had just bicycled over with several tubs of food to give to the students. ''We'll continue to give contributions as long as there are students here.''\nOne of China's retired leaders lent his support Monday to Prime Minister Li Peng in his power struggle with the Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang. Peng Zhen, the former head of the National People's Congress, supported Mr. Li's military crackdown against the democracy movement and without naming anyone he seemed to attack Mr. Zhao by criticizing ''the very small number of conspirators and bad elements who took advantage of the situation to create turmoil.''\nStill, Mr. Peng's speech was not as hard line as might have been expected, since he is regarded as one of the retired leaders most suspicious of rapid liberalization.",

        "Topic": "2007: The iPhone is released, revolutionizing the smartphone market",
        "Title": "That iPhone Has a Keyboard, but Its Not Mechanical - The New York Times",
        "Content": "SAN FRANCISCO, June 12  If there is a billion-dollar gamble underlying Apples iPhone, it lies in what this smart cellphone does not have: a mechanical keyboard.\nAs the clearest expression yet of the Apple chief executives spartan design aesthetic, the iPhone sports only one mechanical button, to return a user to the home screen. It echoes Steven P. Jobss decree two decades ago that a computer mouse should have a single button. (Most computer mice these days have two.) His argument was that one button ensured that it would be impossible to push the wrong button. \nThe keyboard is built into other phones, those designed for businesspeople as well as those for teenagers. But the lack of a keyboard could be seen as a clever industrial design solution. It has permitted the iPhone to have a 3.5-inch screen. A big screen makes the phone attractive for alternative uses like watching movies and that could open up new revenue streams for Apple and its partner, AT&T. \nThe downside is that typing is done by pecking on the screen with thumbs or fingers, something hardly anyone outside of Apple has experienced yet. The tactile feedback of a mechanical keyboard is a pretty important aspect of human interaction, said Bill Moggeridge, a founder of Ideo, an industrial design company in Palo Alto, Calif. If you take that away you tend to be very insecure. \nMr. Jobs and other Apple executives argue that the keyboard that pops up onscreen will be a painless compromise. The iPhones onscreen keyboard has a dictionary-lookup feature that tries to predict the word being typed, catching errors as they are made.\nThat, of course, requires users to learn the new system, a task that Apple executives acknowledge may require several days. Last month at an industry conference, Mr. Jobs dismissed doubts about the decision to rely on a virtual keyboard, saying that users only had to learn to trust the keyboard, and then you will fly.\nYet in the days before the phone is scheduled to go on sale at Apple and AT&T stores around the country, designers and marketers of electronic devices centers are having a spirited debate about whether consumers will have the patience to overcome the hurdle that will be required to type without the familiar tactile feedback offered by conventional keyboards. \nApple is making other compromises. The AT&T Edge cellular network transmits data more slowly than those of rivals, but the iPhone will still be equipped with Wi-Fi for Web access. The phone will not accept memory cards. \nThe keyboard, however, is the biggest worry. At worst, customers will return the products. Currently AT&T gives customers 30 days to return handsets, but it is not clear whether it will maintain that policy for the iPhone. Any significant number of returns of the iPhone could conceivably undermine what until now has been a remarkable promotional blitzkrieg that culminates in the phones release June 29. \nThere has never been a massively successful consumer device based solely on a touch screen, warned Sky Dayton, chief executive of Helio, a cellular network service that has recently introduced an innovative handset that integrates Google maps with a G.P.S. system and another feature that physically locates friends using Helio phones.\n Palm was successful, he noted, despite requiring the Palm Pilots users to enter text with a stylus using its own writing system called Graffiti. But the company eventually retreated and put a mechanical keyboard on its Treo smartphones.\nTexting is central to an entire generation of people, Mr. Dayton argued, and Apple is taking a risk in not making that a central design feature. There is a generation of users who are always online and who dont communicate the way their parents did, he said. Theyre e-mailing; theyre texting; theyre I.M.-ing.\nTo be sure, Apple has had its share of product design hits and misses both under Mr. Jobss command and while he was in exile from the computer maker from 1985 to 1997. The Apple III was a well-designed computer, but was undermined by shoddy manufacturing. Several years later, the Lisa, the first commercial PC with a graphical user interface, and an infamously poorly designed Twiggy floppy disk drive, generated excitement but failed commercially. More recently, the Apple Cube, which was perhaps Mr. Jobss most daring design statement, drew critical praise and few sales. \nBut the comparison that could haunt the iPhone most comes from the specter of a former Apple chief executive, John Sculley, and his Newton. Billed as the original personal digital assistant, the Newton relied on a stylus for entering text. When users fumbled with its character recognition system, the machine went from hype to humiliation. \nAlthough a small team of dedicated Apple engineers ultimately improved the technology, it was too late to save the Newton as a product.\nFew industrial designers believe that the iPhone will suffer the Newtons fate. Indeed, many leading designers argue that even before the iPhone has reached the market, it has changed consumer electronics industry standards irrevocably. Dispensing with a physical keyboard has given software an increased importance over hardware in product design, said Mark Rolston, senior vice president at Frog Design, an industrial design consulting firm.\nA result, he said, has been a richer conversation between Frogs designers and customers because the software presents a much wider range of options for features. This is great for us because the carriers werent listening, Mr. Rolston said. They were slightly adjusting the soft-keys.\nOvernight that has changed and that has resulted in significant new business for design companies like Frog. Were being engaged by many more customers with more aggressive ideas about what to do, he said.\nMr. Rolston believes that Mr. Jobs will get away with his gamble. They took a risk and its a bold step for the industry, he said. This is a worthwhile risk.\nIndeed, the handful of users outside Apple who have been able to play with the hand-held device report that the quirky company has made an important step forward in the art of controlling computer systems. It may teach a new generation of technology users to use their fingers rather than a mouse  a four-decade-old technology  as a pointing and command device. \nApples multitouch technology  which permits control gestures with one or more fingers or thumbs  and which is now also being explored by a variety of other companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and others, is a much more direct way to interact with a computer. Software designers have injected virtual physics into the users experience. For example, sliding a finger along the screen in a directory will cause the index to slide as if it were a piece of paper on a flat surface.\nMr. Jobss new phone may resonate with a new kind of mobile user, said Donald A. Norman, a product designer who is co-director of the Segal Design Institute at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\nApple says, Were not selling to the person who lives on his BlackBerry, were selling to the person who listens to music and surfs the Web,  he said.\nAnd even Mr. Jobss competitors are rooting for him to win.\nWhen I first saw iPhone I was very excited, said Benjamin Bederson, co-founder and vice president for client technologies at ZenZui, a Seattle-based mobile phone software company, which is commercializing technologies that were developed at Microsofts research labs. It will raise the expectations. I think that consumers have had the central assumption that cellphone experiences are terrible and theres nothing you can do about it.",

        "Content": "In the deadliest school massacre in the nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school here at lunch time today with guns and explosives, killing as many as 23 students and teachers and wounding at least 20 in a five-hour siege, the authorities said.\nThe two students who are believed to have been the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who were students at Columbine High School, were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the library, said Steve Davis, the spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.\nBeginning about 11:30 A.M., the gunmen, wearing ski masks, stalked through the school as they fired semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers and tossed explosives , with one student being hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the authorities said. Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for hours. One bomb exploded in the library, officials said, and one in a car outside. Two more cars were rigged with bombs.\nAbout 3 P.M., hundreds of police officers evacuated the building and searched for the gunmen. Their bodies and those of several of their victims appeared to have been wired with explosives.\nSheriff John Stone said, ''It appears to be a suicide mission.''\nMr. Davis said that as many as 25 people were dead, ''a mixture of students and faculty.'' He said that most of the bodies were found in the school's entrance, the library and the commons cafeteria. No precise death toll was available.\nKaleb Newberry, 16, said: ''I was in class and one teacher came in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher helped her.''\nStudents said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who called themselves the trench coat mafia, which expressed disdain for racial minorities and athletes. Members of the group found their way out of anonymity at the school by banning together, dressing in dark gothic-style clothing including long black coats. They became easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the school, since every day, regardless of the weather, they wore their coats. [Page A17.]\nToday the gunmen appeared to aim at minority members and athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well as peers who had poked fun at the group in the past.\nSchool officials had had no reports of trouble from the suspects, Mr. Davis said.\nSome victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue. By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said.\nMr. Davis said at a news conference tonight that two other students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting.\n''You can't really go in and do this kind of damage without a lot of preparation.'' Mr. Davis said, ''without a lot of ammunition and apparently some type of bombs.''\nFourteen-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped in a classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours.\n''I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ''I really didn't think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard crying. We had no clue what was going on.''\n''Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said tonight in an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network. ''And he just put the gun in my face and started laughing and saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''\nAnother student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept thinking to herself, ''This can't be happening to our school.''\n''You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman, who also was not identified. ''This should be a safe place.''\nThe families of those killed were being notified tonight at Leawood Elementary School, where students and parents had gathered.\nThe mass shooting was the first at an American school during this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that struck six different communities last year and set off national alarms about teen-age violence. Four girls and a teacher were shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., last March.\nPresident Clinton immediately dispatched a crisis-response team to aid the school community and the victim's families.\n''We don't know yet all the how's or why's of this tragedy; perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the President said in a nationally televised news conference just before 8 P.M. ''St. Paul reminds us that we all see things in life darkly, that we only partly understand what is happening.''\nHe added, ''We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons.''\nA sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried the injured from the high school, past tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a packed student parking lot.\n''I hope we can all pull together, because we will need all our strengths,'' Jane Hammond, Jefferson County superintendent of schools, said tonight. The blood banks in the Denver area have been overwhelmend with calls from donors. Tonight at least three church vigils for the dead and injured.\nJust before 8 P.M., Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in front of the Leawood school for news of her best friend, Julie Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the school.\n''I can't even feel it,'' she said. ''There's no way to know whether she's dead or alive.''\nAbout 3 P.M., SWAT teams police officers used a fire truck and an armored car to get close to the building, dozens of students raced out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud, others holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads. Police said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by mingling with the trapped students.\nOne student, bloodied from an injury, broke out a second-story window, and climbed down into the hands of the police.\nAs police officers established a wide perimeter around the beige school, students and school workers gathered on nearby tree-lined streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the building.\nAs fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.\nTrapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file cabinets.\nOne cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a woman's bathroom said, ''We could hear them blowing the heck out of the place.''\nA student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ''I heard gunshots going off, bullets ricocheting off lockers.''\nThe trench coat mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and the Gothic look popularized by the rock singer Marilyn Manson, neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark eyeliner, one student said.\n''It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret, a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition only his first name be used.\nThe group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from Columbine, said that residents had known about the group for about five years, and that no one considered it a threat.\n''Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to do with,'' Mr. McCaffrey said. ''They weren't particularly feared. They were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''\nStudents said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described the group as ''nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to fit in.''\nBret suggested the mafia might have targeted athletes out of resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.\nThe students ''weren't really accepted as younger kids and as they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said. ''They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''\nDavid Mesch, another student, who was searching for his mother who works for the school, said, ''They were wearing masks; they were members of the trench coat mafia.''\nPresident Clinton said tonight that he was ''profoundly shocked and saddened by the tragedy today in Littleton.''\nIn an age when cellular telephones are increasingly common among high school students, several trapped students called television stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.\n''I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added, ''There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''\nAware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom television set, he said, ''I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung up.\nIn a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without commercial breaks all afternoon. Broadcast and cable networks turned to local affiliates for help with their coverage.\n''This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a suburban Denver high school, he said, ''We have to ask ourselves what kind of children we are raising.''\nAt the White House, the President said the nation should focus on praying for the victims' families and others at the school. He said that Attorney General Janet Reno was closely monitoring the situation, and that he had spoken this afternoon with Governor Owens and Patricia Holloway, the county commissioner, whose comments he shared with the nation.\nIn midafternoon, police officers briefly detained three young white men who wore camouflaged pants and black jackets, next to the high school. After they were released, the men said they knew the gunmen inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket were the words, ''Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign printed over a cross.\n''Blood was going all over,'' a shaken girl said, as she was comforted by her father. Those here were reminded of other school shooting incidents.\nBob Sapin, a student, told a television station minutes after watching the shootings, ''I just can't believe it is happening at my school.''",

        "Title": "U.S. ATTACKED; HIJACKED JETS DESTROY TWIN TOWERS AND HIT PENTAGON IN DAY OF TERROR - The New York Times",
        "Content": "It kept getting worse.\nThe horror arrived in episodic bursts of chilling disbelief, signified first by trembling floors, sharp eruptions, cracked windows. There was the actual unfathomable realization of a gaping, flaming hole in first one of the tall towers, and then the same thing all over again in its twin. There was the merciless sight of bodies helplessly tumbling out, some of them in flames.\nFinally, the mighty towers themselves were reduced to nothing. Dense plumes of smoke raced through the downtown avenues, coursing between the buildings, shaped like tornadoes on their sides.\nEvery sound was cause for alarm. A plane appeared overhead. Was another one coming? No, it was a fighter jet. But was it friend or enemy? People scrambled for their lives, but they didn't know where to go. Should they go north, south, east, west? Stay outside, go indoors? People hid beneath cars and each other. Some contemplated jumping into the river.\nFor those trying to flee the very epicenter of the collapsing World Trade Center towers, the most horrid thought of all finally dawned on them: nowhere was safe.\nFor several panic-stricken hours yesterday morning, people in Lower Manhattan witnessed the inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the unthinkable. ''I don't know what the gates of hell look like, but it's got to be like this,'' said John Maloney, a security director for an Internet firm in the trade center. ''I'm a combat veteran, Vietnam, and I never saw anything like this.''\nThe first warnings were small ones. Blocks away, Jim Farmer, a film composer, was having breakfast at a small restaurant on West Broadway. He heard the sound of a jet. An odd sound -- too loud, it seemed, to be normal. Then he noticed: ''All the pigeons in the street flew up.''\nIt was the people outside, on the sidewalk, who saw the beginning. At 8:45, David Blackford was walking toward work in a downtown building. He heard a jet engine and glanced up. ''I saw this plane screaming overhead,'' he said. ''I thought it was too low. I thought it wasn't going to clear the tower.''\nWithin moments, his fears were confirmed. The plane slammed into the north face of 1 World Trade Center. As he watched, he said, ''You could see the concussion move up the building.''\n''It was a large plane flying low,'' said Robert Pachino, another witness. ''There was no engine trouble. He didn't try to maneuver. This plane was on a mission.''\nDark spots fell from the sides of the buildings, and at first it wasn't clear what they were. Sarah Sampino, who worked across the street, noticed black smoke outside and went to the window. ''We saw bodies flying out of the windows,'' she said. ''It was the 85th floor. I used to work on that floor.''\nJames Wang, 21, a photography student snapping pictures of people doing tai chi at a nearby park, looked up and saw people high in the north tower. They seemed like tiny figurines, and he didn't know if they were awaiting rescue or merely looking out. ''They were standing up there,'' he said. ''And they jumped. One woman, her dress was billowing out.''\nInside the towers, people felt it without knowing what it was. At about 15 minutes to 9, Anne Prosser, 29, rode the elevator to the 90th floor of Tower 1, where her global banking office was. As the doors opened, she heard what seemed like an explosion. She didn't know it, but the first plane had just hit several floors above her.\n''I got thrown to the ground before I got to our suite,'' she said. ''I crawled inside. Not everybody was at work.'' She said she tried to leave but there was so much debris in the air she couldn't breathe. Port Authority rescuers finally steered her to a stairway.\nTim Lingenfelder, 36, an office manager at a small investment banking firm, was sitting before his computer terminal on the 52nd floor of Tower 1. He had just sent an e-mail to his sister in Minnesota. Nothing special -- just how was she and what he had had for breakfast.\nThe windows rattled. He heard a loud noise. The entire building shook. He looked up. Outside the windows, he noticed rubble falling, and he thought, ''That can't be from here.''\nOnly two others were at work, a father and son who were both bond traders. They said they had better get out. They hurried to the stairs and, along with flocks of others, began their descent.\n''When I got to the 18th floor, my cell phone rang,'' Mr. Lingenfelder said. ''It was my sister. She said a plane had hit and to get out now.''\nOn the 32nd floor, the entourage was stuck for about 20 minutes because of smoke. Everyone ducked into offices on the floor to catch their breath. Mr. Lingenfelder peered out the window and saw a body lying on the roof of the hotel.\nThey returned to the stairs and made it out onto the plaza. Rubble and debris was all around. On the street there was endless paper and unmatched shoes.\nJohn Cerqueira, 22, and Mike Ben Fanter, 36, were working on the 81st floor of 1 World Trade Center when they felt the collision. ''People were freaking out,'' said Mr. Fanter, a sales manager. ''I tried to get them in the center of the office. About 40 people. I led them to the hall down the steps.''\nHe continued: ''We stopped on the 68th floor. I could hear people screaming. There was a woman in a wheelchair. John and I carried her down from the 68th floor to the 5th floor, where we got out. We started to see people jumping from the top of the World Trade Center.''\nTeresa Foxx, 37, works at an investment banking firm a block from the World Trade Center, and she had dropped off her 15-month-old daughter, Trinity, at the Discovery Learning Center on the plaza level of 5 World Trade Center, the building adjacent to the two towers. While she was in her office, Ms. Foxx heard the blast and immediately knew it was a bomb. ''Ever since I enrolled her in the World Trade Center, I keep thinking about the bombing that they had there,'' she said.\nShe grabbed her purse and went outside and began running toward the daycare center. Other people were speeding toward her, crying and screaming. She was crying herself. She had to get her daughter.\nBy the time she got to the center, the children had been evacuated several blocks away. She hurried over there and found her daughter. ''I just grabbed her and held her,'' she said. ''I was still crying, the other parents were still crying, but we all got our children.''\nWhen she got home, Ms. Foxx told her husband, ''Now I understand why people run into burning buildings.''\nWithin about 15 minutes of the first crash, the second plane struck the neighboring tower.\nPeople in the street panicked and ran. Some tripped, fell, got knocked down, were pulled up. People lost their keys, their phones, their handbags, their shoes.\nBrianne Woods, a student at Pace University, was walking to class, and as she passed a Burger King not a hundred feet from the trade center she heard a blast and felt the ground shake. She ran to a bank, where people were banging on the glass, breaking it, trying to get inside. ''I saw a guy bleeding from the head right by the bank,'' she said. ''People were getting stomped on under the crowd. I saw a lady with no shoes, her feet were bleeding. I was probably in there for about 10 minutes, and I was hysterical.''\nHer brother worked in the World Trade Center and she didn't know if he was in there. She learned later that he had not gone to work.\nShe happened to have her cat, Oliver, with her, and she began wandering around, clutching her cat carrier, dazed. ''I saw two people jump out,'' she said. ''It was horrible. I felt I was in a bad nightmare.''\nThen a calm set in again. For blocks around, all the way up to 14th Street, the sidewalks were a mass of people, eerily quiet, for the incomprehension had struck them mute. As emergency vehicles, sirens blaring, sped downtown, people stood and gaped at the towers with holes in them. Many people were steadily inching downtown, not imagining anything worse was to come.\nMarilyn Mulcahy, 31, had a business appointment at 9 at an office on Broadway a few blocks from the World Trade Center. She got off the subway at Chambers and Church Streets. She saw what she believed were pieces of a plane engine on the sidewalk, police officers running tape around it. She saw the holes in the towers and was dumbstruck.\nReason dictated caution, to get out of the area, but she was overcome with shock. Almost unknowingly, she walked to the office where her appointment was. Everyone had left. Even so, she took the time to scribble a note that she had been there and would call later.\nBack on the street, fear caught up with her. She changed out of her heels into flat shoes she had in her bag and ran uptown.\nOn the corner of Vesey and Church Streets, across from the Borders Books and Music store in the corner of the trade center, a small-boned woman, her hair caked with blood, was sitting on the curb, shaking uncontrollably. One eye was clouded over. A man in a business suit was lying on a stretcher, being loaded into an ambulance. Emergency workers came to comfort the woman. Five feet away, another rescue worker crouched down next to a heavyset woman who was breathing through an inhaler and hugged her.\nSome Trade Center workers blessed their luck at being late for work. Kathleen Dendy, 50, had gotten her hair cut and so never got to her office at her usual 8:30. She worked on the 99th floor. Rajesh Trivedi, 40, a computer programmer, normally reported at 7, but he had to drop his son off at school and so didn't get in. He worked on the 80th floor.\nA plane was heard overhead and people looked up. Another one, they thought. ''No, it's a fighter,'' someone said. ''Ours.''\n''Are you sure?'' a woman asked.\nMany people were busy on cell phones, trying to reach friends and relatives they knew in the buildings or to alert their own loved ones that they were all right. But the circuits overloaded. Fear mounted.\nAnd then it got even worse.\nPolice officers warned people in the vicinity to move north, that the buildings could fall, but most people found that unthinkable. They stayed put or gravitated closer.\nAbruptly, there was an ear-splitting noise. The south tower shook, seemed to list in one direction and them began to come down, imploding upon itself.\n''It looked like a demolition,'' said Andy Pollock.\n''It started exploding,'' said Ross Milanytch, 57, who works at nearby Chase Manhattan Bank. ''It was about the 70th floor. And each second another floor exploded out for about eight floors, before the cloud obscured it all.''\nSeth Bower was on Broadway when the force of the collapse knocked him over onto other people. Bodies fell on top of him -- not all of them, he thought, alive.\nA plume of smoke reminiscent of an atomic bomb rose upward and then descended to street level and sped uptown. People began running, chased by the smoke. The air rained white ash and plaster dust, coating people until they looked ghostlike.\nSome people were screaming, and many were in shock. ''Don't breathe the air,'' people shouted. ''It could be toxic.'' People held their breath or covered their faces as best they could with cloths or their shirts.\nLisle Taylor, 26, a recruiter with Goldman, Sachs, had just gotten out of a nearby subway stop and saw hundreds of pieces of paper in the air. She thought it was a marketing campaign. Then she looked up and saw the tower collapsing. ''A woman grabbed my hand,'' she said. ''She was saying the Lord's Prayer.''\nFor several blocks, everything was black. People found their eyes burned. Many wondered if they were seeing the very face of death.\nMichael Clinch, a security officer for an Internet company, left his office soon after the first plane struck and was standing on Broadway talking to a police officer when the first tower fell. He saw a woman running, grabbed her and pulled her under a sport utility vehicle with him. ''We got under the truck and waited until it got light again,'' he said. ''There were cars just blowing up. They were trying to get equipment off this emergency truck and get it into a building and all these cars just blew up. One would blow up and set off the next one. It got so bad we just couldn't do anything any more and we had to get out of there.''\nTen or so blocks north of the towers, the smoke had been outrun and it began to dissipate into the air. People stopped, turned and looked downtown. As the air cleared, an unthinkable site presented itself: empty space where a 110-story tower had been.\nPeople gasped. They trembled. They sobbed.\n''It can't be,'' an elderly woman said. ''It just can't be. Where did it go? Oh, lord, where did it go?''\nMany of the onlookers stayed put, frozen in horror. Slowly, the next thought crept into their consciousness: The other tower would come down too.\nSeveral people voiced the thought: ''Get out of here, the other tower's going to fall.''\nPeople started walking briskly north until the premonition became real -- another horrifying eruption, as one floor after another seemed to detonate. Another giant cloud, soot, smoke streaming through the avenues. Again, people ran.\nMany of them stopped at Canal Street and watched the smoke dissolve. People cried at what they saw: a crystalline sky with nothing in it.\n''Oh my God,'' Tim Lingenfelder said, ''there's nothing there.''\nThat was when he lost it and began to cry.\nPeople stood, numb, transfixed by what had to be a mirage. ''All that were left of the buildings that you could see were the steel girders in like a triangular sail shape,'' said Ross Milanytch. ''The dust was about an inch and a half thick on the ground.''\nOnlookers gathered in clumps and tried to understand. People with cars opened the doors and turned on the radios, and knots of people leaned close to hear what was happening. The news came across of of the plane at the Pentagon, the plane in Pittsburgh.\n''It's like Pearl Harbor,'' said a middle-aged man at a small parking lot on Canal Street. ''It's Pearl Harbor. It's war.''\n''It's sickos,'' someone else said. ''Sickos.''\n''This is America,'' a man said. ''How can it happen in America? How?''\nA young man came around imploring people to report to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital to donate blood.\nLines five, eight deep developed at pay phones, but many of the phones didn't work. Most of the downtown businesses were closed. People borrowed cell phones, but the heavy phone traffic made communicating hard if not impossible. Countless people spent hours not knowing where a wife, a husband or a child was.\nFor hours, people lingered, uncertain where to go or what to do in a no longer plausible world. Some felt compelled to leave Manhattan, taking ferries to New Jersey. A man holding his weeping wife headed toward the Manhattan bridge, telling her, ''Let's walk over the bridge to Brooklyn. They can't hurt us in Brooklyn.''\nLate in the afternoon, hundreds of rescue workers remained outside where the trade towers once loomed, watching the stubs of the buildings continue to burn into infinity. Several stories still stood, but it was hard to judge how many. Above the second story was nothing but an intense orange glow.\n''It's eerie,'' said Monet Harris, 22, a transit worker. ''You always look for those two buildings. You always know where you are when you see those two buildings. And now they're gone.''",

        "Title": "QUEBEC, BY RAZOR-THIN MARGIN, VOTES 'NO' ON LEAVING CANADA - The New York Times",
        "Content": "By the slenderest of margins, voters decided today that Quebec would remain a part of Canada.\nWith more than 99 percent of the votes counted, Quebec residents rejected by 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent a proposal that could have led to the creation of a new nation. The vote ended a frenzied and bitter referendum campaign that divided families and neighborhoods and caused all Canadians to wonder whether their country would eventually disintegrate.\nMore than 92 percent of Quebec's 5 million eligible voters cast their ballots, a record for any vote in the province's history. The previous record of 85.6 percent was set in the last Quebec independence referendum 15 years ago. The separatists lost then, too, 60 percent to 40 percent.\nFinal returns from 22,400 polling stations showed the federalists winning with a 50,000-vote margin of 4.65 million cast.\nThe narrow margin could force Ottawa to shift its focus from national economic issues to matters related to Quebec's place in the federation.\n\"Everybody will claim victory,\" said Pierre Berton, a Canadian historian, who said \"there will be years of negotiations\" as a result of the strong showing by the separatists, who are likely to continue to press their demands.\nWhen the separatists took an early lead, the Canadian dollar plunged on currency markets, but as the shape of the final outcome became clear, the dollar recovered and began to gain strength.\nMost analysts called the vote tonight a mandate for renewed federalism. One of Prime Minister Jean Chretien's many problems will be to sell any changes to English Canada, which has always balked at giving Quebec any greater privileges or rights than other provinces.\nBut separatists emphasized that tonight's vote, even though they were on the losing side, sends a strong message to the rest of Canada that their concerns must be met.\n\"Don't just love us, recognize us,\" said Louise Beaudoin, Quebec's Minister for Inter-governmental affairs. \"Canada on paper is still a country but clearly there is something wrong with that country.\"\nThe early reaction of the separatists was that they had not yet given up. Nearly 60 percent of the French speakers voted in favor today. \"We were defeated by money and the ethnic vote,\" Quebec's Premier, Jacques Parizeau, told followers tonight in a combative speech tinged with a spirit of revenge.\nMr. Parizeau was referring to spending to influence voters in the province and the 20 percent of the population that does not use French as its main language.\nBoth Mr. Parizeau and Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, promised that Quebecers would be given another chance to form their own country in the not-too-distant future.\n\"The next time could come more quickly than people believe,\" said Mr. Bouchard, who rescued a flagging sovereignty campaign three weeks ago and nearly brought it to victory.\n\"We shall have our country,\" Mr. Parizeau added.\nFederalist leaders tried to send a conciliatory message. The former Quebec Liberal Premier, Daniel Johnson, who headed the \"no\" campaign in the province, spoke of creating a \"launching pad for a new Quebec within a new Canada.\"\nPrime Minister Chretien told Quebecers tonight he understood their yearning for deep change. \"The time has come for us to turn a new page,\" he said. \"We can emerge stronger.\"\nAlthough the federalists won, the narrowness of the victory has tarnished the Prime Minister's position. Mr. Chretien had promised a clear victory in the referendum but instead is faced with a status quo.\nWhat separatists were seeking was not total secession for the province that embraces one-sixth of Canada's land area and a quarter of its population, but rather a form of independence that would permit joint institutions with Canada and an exchange of trade, labor, capital and commuters.\nThe vote came after a seven-week battle that wound up with both sides frantically seeking to convert 500,000 undecided voters.\nDespite overcast skies and occasional snow flurries, a kind of festive atmosphere prevailed. Schools were closed. Universities canceled classes. The Canadian national anthem resonated in the House of Commons.\nLines at many of the 21,000 polling stations, open from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M., were long and some voters waited hours to cast a ballot.\nOne woman who had already waited two hours outside her voting place, a Unitarian church in downtown Montreal, said, \"Never before in any election have I seen crowds like these.\"\nA student from McGill University in the same line said, \"It must be a 90 percent turnout.\" Both said they were voting against sovereignty, and both insisted on not being identified.\nSeparatists tapped into the pain and frustration that many Quebecers feel about Canada's repeated refusal to accommodate their demands for greater autonomy to protect their culture and language.\nFederalists tried to keep the campaign centered on the costs of separation, which they said would include much higher unemployment and crushing austerity as the new nation sought to take its place in a competitive international environment.\nQuebec now enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the industrialized world. Its per capita income would place it 15th among industrial countries, ahead of Australia, Britain, Sweden, Finland and New Zealand. In terms of gross domestic product it would rank 17th.\nThe weight of the economic arguments combined with the general attachment that many Quebecers feel toward Canada initially created problems for the separatists in selling their vision.\nA Parti Quebecois Government under Mr. Parizeau came to power a year ago promising an early referendum on sovereignty.\nBut after opinion polls well into this year continued to show only around 40 to 45 percent of Quebecers favoring absolute secession, Mr. Parizeau, strongly influenced by Mr. Bouchard, whose Bloc Quebecois represents separatists in the House of Commons, shifted strategy.\nThey agreed to try to recruit soft nationalists to their cause by committing to a less doctrinaire program in which they would seek some kind of vaguely defined economic and political association with Canada.\nThis was reminiscent of the platform in the 1980 campaign of Rene Levesque, the fiery founder of the Parti Quebecois, who wanted to redefine the province's relationship with Canada rather than have it strike out on its own.\nThe new Bouchard-Parizeau strategy culminated last June 12 in an alliance of three parties, the Bloc, the Parti Quebecois and a splinter group of former Liberals called the Action Democratique du Quebec, headed by the former head of the Liberals' youth wing, 25-year-old Mario Dumont.\nThey forged a platform calling for joint institutions between Canada and an independent Quebec to assure the free flow of trade, labor, capital and people.\nThat platform, as well as a bill on the future of Quebec, the the so-called Bill 1 that was introduced in the Quebec legislature in September to set out a framework for achieving sovereignty, were incorporated into the referendum question:\n\"Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign, after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership, within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec and the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?\"\nYet even with that new platform, the separatists had trouble firing up voters. Until about three weeks ago, polls showed the federalists with a comfortable lead.\nA turning point occurred when Mr. Bouchard, a spellbinding orator, took over the campaign from the less popular Mr. Parizeau and focused on powerful emotional arguments related to the latent resentments that many Quebecers still bear against English Canada. Such feelings are echoed in the provincial motto, inscribed on all Quebec license plates, Je Me Souviens (I Remember).\nFederalists, on the other hand, became overconfident. Mr. Chretien thought he could win by simply keeping a low profile and letting the economic scare tactics work.\nBut the tactics began working against the federalists, leaving many Quebecers resentful and playing into the powerful emotional arguments of Mr. Bouchard. For many Quebecers it became a choice of balancing fear against hope.\nLast week as polls showed the separatists surging ahead on the fervor of Mr. Bouchard's oratory, the federalists began panicking. Last Tuesday Mr. Chretien skipped a Parliament Hill ceremony honoring Canadian peacekeepers and did not attend a question-and-answer period in the House of Commons. He wanted more time to work on a speech for a \"no\" rally in Montreal. It was the first time that the Prime Minister had shown any signs of changing his routine.\nBut a big turning point in the campaign for the federalists had little to do with Mr. Chretien. It was the almost spontaneous demonstration last Friday when tens of thousands of Canadians from outside Quebec poured into Montreal to join federalist Quebecers in a call for unity and to urge Quebec to remain part of their country.\nVolunteers in the \"no\" camp said that eruption of national pride, which was followed up by more modest demonstrations throughout the country over the weekend, was a big morale booster.\nAt one of these rallies on Sunday in Hull, Quebec, just across the river from Ottawa, Mr. Chretien said, \"Canada without Quebec is no more Canada, and Quebec without Canada is no more Quebec.\"",

        "Title": "Putin Reclaims Crimea for Russia and Bitterly Denounces the West - The New York Times",
        "Content": "MOSCOW  President Vladimir V. Putin reclaimed Crimea as a part of Russia on Tuesday, reversing what he described as a historic injustice inflicted by the Soviet Union 60 years ago and brushing aside international condemnation that could leave Russia isolated for years to come.\nIn an emotional address steeped in years of resentment and bitterness at perceived slights from the West, Mr. Putin made it clear that Russias patience for post-Cold War accommodation, much diminished of late, had finally been exhausted. Speaking to the countrys political elite in the Grand Kremlin Palace, he said he did not seek to divide Ukraine any further, but he vowed to protect Russias interests there from what he described as Western actions that had left Russia feeling cornered.\nCrimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people, Mr. Putin declared in his address, delivered in the chandeliered St. Georges Hall before hundreds of members of Parliament, governors and others. His remarks, which lasted 47 minutes, were interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing ovations and at the end chants of Russia, Russia. Some in the audience wiped tears from their eyes.\nA theme coursing throughout his remarks was the restoration of Russia after a period of humiliation following the Soviet collapse, which he has famously called the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\nHe denounced what he called the global domination of one superpower and its allies that emerged. They cheated us again and again, made decisions behind our back, presenting us with completed facts, he said. Thats the way it was with the expansion of NATO in the East, with the deployment of military infrastructure at our borders. They always told us the same thing: Well, this doesnt involve you.\nThe speed of Mr. Putins annexation of Crimea, redrawing an international border that has been recognized as part of an independent Ukraine for 23 years, has been breathtaking and so far apparently unstoppable. \nWhile his actions, which the United States, Europe and Ukraine do not recognize, provoked renewed denunciations and threats of tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation, it remained unclear how far the West was willing to go to punish Mr. Putin. The leaders of what had been the Group of 8 nations announced they would meet next week as the Group of 7, excluding Russia from a club Russia once desperately craved to join.\nCertainly the sanctions imposed on Russia ahead of Tuesdays steps did nothing to dissuade Mr. Putin, as he rushed to make a claim to Crimea that he argued conformed to international law and precedent. In his remarks he made clear that Russia was prepared to withstand worse punishment in the name of restoring a lost part of the countrys historic empire, effectively daring world leaders to sever political or economic ties and risk the consequences to their own economies.\nMr. Putin, the countrys paramount leader for more than 14 years, appeared to be gambling that the outrage would eventually pass, as it did after Russias war with Georgia in 2008, because a newly assertive Russia would be simply too important to ignore on the world stage. As with any gamble, though, the annexation of Crimea carries potentially grave risks.\nOnly hours after Mr. Putin declared that not a single shot had been fired in the military intervention in Crimea, a group of soldiers opened fire as they stormed a Ukrainian military mapping office near Simferopol, killing a Ukrainian soldier and wounding another, according to a Ukrainian officer inside the base and a statement by Ukraines Defense Ministry.\nThe base appeared to be under the control of the attacking soldiers, who like most of the Russians in Crimea wore no insignia, and the ministry said that Ukrainian forces in Crimea were now authorized to use force to defend themselves.\nThe episode underscored the fact that the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, as well military bases and ships, remains dangerously unresolved.\nIn the capital, Kiev, Ukraines new prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, declared that the conflict had moved from a political to a military phase and laid the blame squarely on Russia.\nMr. Putins determined response to the ouster of Ukraines president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, last month has left American and European leaders scrambling to find an adequate response after initially clinging to the hope that Mr. Putin was prepared to find a political solution  or off ramp  to an escalating crisis that began with the collapse of Mr. Yanukovychs government on the night of Feb. 21.\nWithin a week, Russian special operations troops had seized control of strategic locations across Crimea, while the regional authorities moved to declare independence and schedule a referendum on joining Russia that was held on Sunday.\nEven as others criticized the vote as a fraud, Mr. Putin moved quickly on Monday to recognize its result, which he called more than convincing with nearly 97 percent of voters in favor of seceding from Ukraine. By Tuesday he signed a treaty of accession with the regions new leaders to make Crimea and the city of Sevastopol the 84th and 85th regions of the Russian Federation.\nThe treaty requires legislative approval, but that is a mere formality given Mr. Putins unchallenged political authority and the wild popularity of his actions, which have raised his approval ratings and unleashed a nationalistic fervor that has drowned out the few voices of opposition or even caution about the potential costs to Russia.\nMr. Putin appeared Tuesday evening at a rally and concert on Red Square to celebrate an event charged with emotional and historical significance for many Russians. Among the music played was a sentimental Soviet song called Sevastopol Waltz.\nAfter a long, hard and exhaustive journey at sea, Crimea and Sevastopol are returning to their home harbor, to the native shores, to the home port, to Russia! Mr. Putin told the crowd. When he finished speaking, he joined a military chorus in singing the national anthem.\nHe recited a list of grievances  from the Soviet Unions transfer of Crimea to the Ukrainian republic in 1954, to NATOs expansion to Russias borders, to its war in Kosovo in 1999, when he was a little-known aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin, to the conflict in Libya that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 on what he called the false pretense of a humanitarian intervention.\nSince Russias stealthy takeover of Crimea began, Mr. Putin has said very little in public about his ultimate goals. His only extensive remarks came in a news conference with a pool of Kremlin journalists in which he appeared uncomfortable, uncertain and angry at times. In the grandeur of the Kremlins walls on Tuesday, Mr. Putin sounded utterly confident and defiant.\nReaching deep into Russian and Soviet history, he cast himself as the guardian of the Russian people, even those beyond its post-Soviet borders, restoring a part of an empire that the collapse of the Soviet Union had left abandoned to the cruel fates of what he described as a procession of hapless democratic leaders in Ukraine.\nMillions of Russians went to bed in one country and woke up abroad, he said. Overnight, they were minorities in the former Soviet republics, and the Russian people became one of the biggest  if not the biggest  divided nations in the world.\nHe cited the 10th-century baptism of Prince Vladimir, whose conversion to Orthodox Christianity transformed the kingdom then known as Rus into the foundation of the empire that became Russia. He called Kiev the mother of Russian cities, making clear that he considered Ukraine, along with Belarus, to be countries where Russias own interests would remain at stake regardless of the fallout from Crimeas annexation.\nHe listed the cities and battlefields of Crimea  from the 19th-century war with Britain, France and the Turks to the Nazi sieges of World War II  as places dear to our hearts, symbolizing Russian military glory and outstanding valor.\nHe said that the United States and Europe had crossed a red line on Ukraine by throwing support to the new government that quickly emerged after Mr. Yanukovych fled the capital following months of protests and two violent days of clashes that left scores dead.\nMr. Putin, as he has before, denounced the uprising as a coup carried out by Russophobes and neo-Nazis and abetted by foreigners, saying it justified Russias efforts to protect Crimeas population.\nIf you press a spring too hard, he said, it will recoil.\nHe justified the annexation using the same arguments that the United States and Europe cited to justify the independence of Kosovo from Serbia and even quoted from the American submission to the United Nations International Court when it reviewed the matter in 2009.\nMr. Putin did not declare a new Cold War, but he bluntly challenged the post-Soviet order that had more or less held for nearly a quarter-century, and made it clear that Russia was prepared to defend itself from any further encroachment or interference in areas it considers part of its core security, including Russia itself.\nHe linked the uprisings in Ukraine and the Arab world and ominously warned that there were efforts to agitate inside Russia. He suggested that dissenters at home would be considered traitors, a theme that has reverberated through society with propagandistic documentaries on state television and moves to mute or close opposition news organizations and websites.\nSome Western politicians already threaten us not only with sanctions, but also with the potential for domestic problems, he said. I would like to know what they are implying  the actions of a certain fifth column, of various national traitors? Or should we expect that they will worsen the social and economic situation, and therefore provoke peoples discontent?",

        "Topic": "1988: The Iran-Contra affair comes to light in the United States",
        "Title": "Washington Talk: The Iran-Contra Affair; McFarlane's Struggle With Himself and the Special Prosecutor - The New York Times",
        "Content": "When he was in New York last Tuesday, Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty on Friday to withholding information from Congress, stopped to consult with an old friend who knows something about special prosecutors and the ways of Washington. He was Richard M. Nixon.\nEven though the former President and many other prominent figures in the world of foreign policy urged him to accept a plea agreement to avoid a long trial, Mr. McFarlane said in an interview that he remained uneasy. Later that day, he instructed his lawyer to call off a tentative deal.\nBut Mr. McFarlane said he changed his mind and agreed to the misdemeanor pleas only after he became convinced that if he refused, a trial over the proposed felony charges of lying to Congress would tarnish his reputation, even if he was eventually acquitted. Prospect of 'Hollow Victory'\n''I would have taken myself and my family through a long process that at the end would have been a hollow victory,'' said Mr. McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding information from Congress about the National Security Council staff's activities in connection with providing assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels.\nPeople familiar with the investigation, meanwhile, said that the special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, was willing to accept the plea to a lesser charge in exchange for Mr. McFarlane's testimony. According to several people familiar with the investigation, Mr. Walsh decided early in the case that Mr. McFarlane was a potentially significant witness whose testimony would be valuable.\nIf he had been indicted, Mr. McFarlane would not have been available as a witness against other Administration officials who were likely to be charged in the case. Mr. Walsh was also said to have been reluctant to bring the more serious charges against a man who attempted suicide a year ago and who has been openly remorseful about his role in the Iran-contra affair.\nThe account of Mr. McFarlane's months of dealings with Mr. Walsh -and how he finally came to accept a plea agreement - provides new insights into the character and motivations of both men, who are likely to figure importantly in any future prosecutions in the affair. Tenacity of Defendant\nInterviews with people involved in the talks suggest that Mr. McFarlane bargained over his fate with the same tenacity that he demonstrated nearly two years ago when he negotiated with the Iranians over the fate of four American hostages in Lebanon. His approach to the case also suggests that Mr. McFarlane hopes to preserve some opportunity to be a voice in future debates over foreign affairs.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Walsh showed that he was willing to be flexible with potential high-level defendants, particularly if it meant strengthening the case against others implicated in the affair.\nPeople familiar with the case said it also showed that Mr. Walsh was prepared to respond to direct appeals, noting that the decision to allow Mr. McFarlane to plead to less than a felony charge came only after a long meeting between the two men.\nMr. Walsh said Friday that Mr. McFarlane's regret over having withheld information from Congress was a factor in the handling of the plea. Hours later, in the interview, Mr. McFarlane was overcome by emotion as he described what he felt as he drove past the White House after having entered his plea at the Federal district courthouse here.\n''I could have prevented this and it's my fault,'' he said. ''I felt sadness that no good's going to come out of this. And a big sense of personal failure.''\nMr. Walsh's comments after the plea left unclear whether Mr. McFarlane's cooperation would bring to light any new information on the Iran-contra affair. In an interview, Mr. McFarlane suggested Friday that the Congressional committees elicted from him virtually everything he had to say on such subjects as President Reagan's knowledge of the operation to resupply the rebels in Nicaragua. Extent of Bush's Knowledge\nHe also said that he would not dispute Vice President Bush's account of his own limited knowledge of the affair.\nIn the case of lesser participants in the affair, Mr. Walsh has obtained testimony by granting immunity from prosecution. But the prosecutors' review of the evidence left them convinced that Mr. McFarlane had made false statements to Congress. Some felt he was also an integral part of the conspiracy to funnel aid to the rebels, a contention Mr. McFarlane has denied both in Congressional testimony and interviews.\nBeginning several months ago, negotiations began between Mr. Walsh's staff and Leonard Garment, Mr. McFarlane's lawyer and close friend.\nIt has been an odd friendship, for the two men could not be more different in style. Mr. McFarlane, the son of a Texas Congressman, speaks in low measured tones, and was known inside the Government for his reserved manner and his sober, balanced approach to issues.\nMr. Garment, by contrast, is a wisecracking New York-born lawyer who is known as the quintessential Washington insider - a player who revels in social splash and high-profile cases that mix politics and law.\nWhen the talks between Mr. Garment and Mr. Walsh's staff began, the two sides were far apart. Mr. Garment insisted that his client had broken no laws and thus faced no criminal liability. Mr. Walsh's assistants replied that they were seriously considering charges under a statute that makes it a felony to make false statements to Federal officials. Mr. McFarlane's lawyers filed a succession of legal papers arguing that this law had never before been applied to a situation like Mr. McFarlane's. McFarlane and Walsh Meet\nThe negotiations were at an impasse for many weeks, with Mr. McFarlane adamantly opposed to pleading guilty to even one felony count. ''I wouldn't know how to live with that,'' Mr. McFarlane said. ''You'd have to step up and fight that.''\nIn early February, Mr. Garment suggested that Mr. Walsh meet personally with Mr. McFarlane to hear his version of events. Shortly after that session, Mr. Walsh agreed to consider misdemeanor charges.\nFrom that moment, the main sticking point was a question that seldom arises in a criminal case: the timing of Mr. McFarlane's sentencing. With a cooperating witness, prosecutors generally prefer to wait until after trials of the others are concluded for sentencing. This allows them to give a full report to the court on the quality of the testimony and its value.\nBut Mr. McFarlane saw this arrangement as potentially damaging to his reputation. He said he feared it would be perceived that he had testified against his former colleagues with a possible jail sentence hanging over his head as an inducement. Trip to New York\nMr. Walsh eventually became amenable to sentencing before the trials, but his deputies warned Mr. McFarlane that if that concession was part of the plea agreement, the number of counts would have to be increased.\nAs of March 4, a preliminary deal had been struck in which Mr. McFarlane would plead guilty to four misdemeanor counts and would be sentenced sometime before the trials.\nFour days later, Mr. McFarlane went to New York for a business meeting and he met with Mr. Nixon while he was there. Mr. McFarlane said the former President urged him to take the plea bargain, although he endorsed his insistence on being sentenced before the trials.\nA problem arose, however, because Mr. McFarlane had come to mistakenly believe that Mr. Walsh would lower the number of counts from four to three. When he learned that this was not the case, he called Mr. Garment and ordered him to call off the deal.\nOver the next few days, Mr. Garment went to work to persuade his client to accept the deal as hammered out the previous week. 'It's Tragic for Him'\nMany people who know Mr. McFarlane expressed sympathy for him. Mr. Nixon, for instance, said in an interview: ''I've known Bud McFarlane going back on 20 years. It's tragic for him and for the nation that he had to go through this ordeal.''\nArthur Liman, chief counsel of the Senate Iran-contra committee, added, ''The McFarlane case is an illustration of how a person who chose public service and would otherwise lead a career of honor can be destroyed by a Presidential decision not to comply with a mandate of Congress and the people.''\n''Once the President decided the Administration would cheat on the Boland Amendment,'' he said, referring to the amendment restricting aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, ''a lot of people got caught up in deceptive conduct that was alien to their nature, and Bud is particularly sympathetic case of that.''\nMr. McFarlane, however, refused to blame President Reagan for his plight. ''I think the President has suffered a lot,'' he said. ''He's had a political loss of immense proportions. I don't have any sense of inequity. The President has taken his licks.''",

        "Title": "THE MIDEAST ACCORD: Diplomacy; For the Unlikely Middleman From Norway, Public Thanks - The New York Times",
        "Content": "Seated in the front row at the White House ceremony today was Johan Jorgen Holst, the Norwegian Foreign Minister, whose mediation played a crucial role in brokering the accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nMr. Holst, 55, known in Europe for his expertise in military and security issues, was the unlikely middleman for months of secret talks in Norway between the longtime adversaries.\nThe Clinton Administration was kept generally apprised of the meetings by Norway, but had no direct influence on the diplomacy that led to the signing today. The efforts by Mr. Holst were hailed by President Clinton, who told an applauding crowd, \"Let us salute also today the Government of Norway for its remarkable role in nurturing this agreement.\"\nAn avid stamp collector who has served in the defense and foreign ministries in a succession of Norwegian Governments, Mr. Holst has been praised for building an informal atmosphere for the talks, which were kept secret for nearly 18 months.\nHe and his wife, Marianne Heiberg, used their home on the outskirts of Oslo as a discreet site for the negotiations that stretched long into the night. At several points, they turned to an unorthodox but effective negotiating aid: their 4-year-old son, Edvard, who played on the living room floor with the Israeli and Palestinian officials.\n\"Conviviality was at least as important as secrecy in this peace process,\" Mr. Holst told the Norwegian press in interviews this month. A Pivotal Role\nHis wife played a pivotal role in the early stages of the dialogue. A scholar at FAFO, the Norwegian Institute for Applied Social Science, she was the author of a study of the living conditions in the occupied territories.\nThe director general of the institute, Terje Rod Larsen, offered in September 1992 to serve as a bridge between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\nAfter the offer was accepted by the Labor Government in Israel, the Norwegians were the hosts of 14 meetings that moved from hotels to country estates to a labor union hall north of Oslo.\nIngvard Havnen, a spokesman for Mr. Holst, said Norway was not as improbable a conduit for the Middle East as some might have suspected. The country has long supplied peacekeeping troops to the United Nations forces in Lebanon, and has maintained friendly contacts with both the P.L.O. and the Israeli Labor Party. Mr. Holst, as Defense Minister, has made many trips to the region to visit the Norwegian troops.\nMr. Havnen responded with the characteristic Norwegian understatement when asked about the reports that his boss might be nominated next year for the Nobel Peace Prize. \"We all had the feeling that this was a truly historic moment,\" he said. \"We felt happy that we were able to play a small part.\"",

        "Topic": "2017: The widespread outbreak of WannaCry ransomware",
        "Title": "In Ransomware Attack, Where Does Microsofts Responsibility Lie? - The New York Times",
        "Content": "SEATTLE  When malicious software first became a serious problem on the internet about 15 years ago, most people agreed that the biggest villain, after the authors of the damaging code, was Microsoft.\nAs a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files.\nThis time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system.\nOn Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsofts president and chief legal officer, wrote a blog post describing the companys efforts to stop the ransomwares spread, including an unusual step it took to release a security update for versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. Mr. Smith wrote, As a technology company, we at Microsoft have the first responsibility to address these issues.\nHe went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the degree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers, the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency.\nOn Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smiths post.\nTo prepare for fallout with customers, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, sent an email to the companys field sales team on Sunday encouraging them to be supportive of businesses targeted by the attack, or even those who were simply aware of it.\nOur key direction to you is to remember that we are in this with our customers  we are trusted advisers, counselors, and suppliers to them, he wrote. More than technical guidance, I want you to make sure you are spending the time needed to understand the concerns they have and that they know we are here to help.\nWhile Microsofts reputation has suffered in the past because of security problems, the companys stock is barely down from the close of trading on Thursday, just before reports of the ransomware.\nPeople have extremely short memories when it comes to this, said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research. I think, realistically, people will move on pretty quickly.\nMicrosoft has recognized the risk that cybersecurity poses to it since about 2002, when Bill Gates, the former chief executive, issued a call to arms inside the company after a wave of malicious software began infecting Windows PCs connected to the internet.\nAs software has become ever more complex, interdependent and interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more vulnerable, Mr. Gates wrote in an email to employees identifying trustworthy computing as Microsofts top priority. Flaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers view of us as a company.\nSince then, the company has poured billions of dollars into security initiatives, employing more than 3,500 engineers dedicated to security. In March, it released a software patch that addressed the vulnerability exploited by the ransomware, known as WannaCry, protecting systems such as Windows 10, its latest operating system.\nYet security flaws in older editions of Windows persist. The company no longer provides regular software updates to Windows XP, a version first released in 2001, unless customers pay for custom support, a practice some observers believe has put users at risk. Late Friday, Microsoft took the unusual step of making patches that protect older systems against WannaCry, including Windows XP, free.\nCompanies like Microsoft should discard the idea that they can abandon people using older software, Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the school of information and library science at the University of North Carolina, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece over the weekend. The money they made from these customers hasnt expired; neither has their responsibility to fix defects.\nBut security experts challenged that argument, saying that Microsoft could not be expected to keep updating old software products indefinitely. Providing updates to older systems could make computers more insecure by removing an incentive for users to modernize, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer of F-Secure, a security firm.\nI can understand why they issued an emergency patch for XP after WannaCry was found, but in general, we should just let XP die,  Mr. Hypponen said.\nDespite the high profile of WannaCry, widespread malware outbreaks have become less common over the years, as Microsoft has improved the security of its systems, said Ziv Mador, vice president for security research at Trustwave, a security services firm. But the profits that criminals can make through ransomware and other malicious code ensure the problem will never vanish.\nEven though its becoming harder and harder, the incentives have increased tremendously, said Mr. Mador, who previously worked on security response at Microsoft.",

        "Title": "With Le Shuttle Diplomacy, the Tunnel Opens - The New York Times",
        "Content": "There was fog in the English Channel on Friday, but the Continent was not cut off.\nQueen Elizabeth II traveled through the Channel Tunnel in a gleaming Eurostar express to meet President Franois Mitterrand and inaugurate the first land link between England and the Continent.\nNinety years after their nations concluded an entente cordiale of peace and cooperation and eight years after the agreement to build the tunnel, the two leaders snipped a red, white and blue ribbon that signified officially that Britain is no longer an island.\nAlthough full passenger service through the tunnel will not begin for several months, it was a historic moment not only for the two countries but also for the European Union. Many commentators on both sides of the Channel argue that the fact of being physically linked to the Continent will make Britain less aloof, psychologically and politically.\nThe queen followed in the footsteps of her predecessor Henry VIII, who came to the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais when it was an English city to conclude a peace accord with Franois I of France.\nThe queen, protected from the drizzle by a large umbrella, stood solemnly next to the French president for the playing of \"God Save the Queen,\" \"The Marseillaise\" and the European Union anthem, the theme from Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\"\nAfter cutting the ribbon at the tunnel terminal, the two leaders went to a windswept plain at Coquelles, near Calais, where they exchanged speeches in a blue-draped tent.\nThe queen, speaking in French, said that to rejoin what nature had separated in prehistoric times \"has been a recurring dream of statesmen and engineers for several centuries.\"\n\"It has fallen to us, Mr. President, to congratulate all those who conceived and brought this link into being,\" she said. \"Undaunted by physical and financial challenges, it is the entrepreneurs and engineers of our time who succeeded, and we have every reason to be proud of their achievements.\"\nMr. Mitterrand called the link \"a major asset for the strengthening of the European Union.\" Later, in England, he said relations between the countries were \"almost always\" cordial. Then he paid tribute to Britain for its support in World War II.\n\"How could we, the French, forget that in those days our country found aid and assistance and strength thanks to you? I wish to say thank you on behalf of France,\" he said, turning to the queen.\nAfter lunch, Queen Elizabeth and President Mitterrand rode in the queen's Rolls-Royce to board Le Shuttle, the train that will move cars through the tunnel. The shuttle service will start this summer, building up to a frequency of at least four trains an hour by next year, according to Eurotunnel, the consortium operating the link.\nLe Shuttle whisked through the 50-kilometer (31-mile) tunnel in 35 minutes to the terminal on the English side, just outside Folkestone, where the queen and Mr. Mitterrand pulled levers launching thousands of balloons and made a second round of speeches.\nThe tunnel is actually three tunnels, linked by galleries every 375 meters. Two large tunnels carry the traffic in each direction while a smaller one in the middle is for service access, or to evacuate passengers in an emergency.\nThe massive shuttle trains are 775 meters long, weigh 2,100 tons and will travel at 160 kilometers an hour (100 miles per hour) carrying hundreds of cars.\nEurotunnel is being prudent about traffic predictions, saying only that it hopes to capture 50 percent of the passenger and 30 percent of the freight markets between Dover and Calais by 1996.\nThe tunnel is about a year late in opening, and exceeded its original budget by 100 percent. It has cost $15 billion, 80 percent in bank credits and the rest in capital raised from hundreds of thousands of shareholders.\nAlthough analysts say the financial future of the tunnel is uncertain, its political and historical significance in uniting two ancient nations was obvious.\n\"It is true that relations between our two countries have fluctuated violently through the ages,\" Queen Elizabeth said. \"But at crucial points in the course of this century, the mixture of French lan and British pragmatism, when united in a common cause, has proved to be a highly successful combination.\"\n\"The tunnel embodies that simple truth,\" she said.",

        "Topic": "1995: The Oklahoma City bombing in the United State",
        "Title": "TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: SECURITY; Overseas, Oklahoma City Bombing Is Seen Through Prism of Experience - The New York Times",
        "Content": "While the Oklahoma City bombing has thrown the United States into a clamorous debate over what steps will be needed to control domestic terrorism, many in the Old World have been looking on with an experienced and somewhat paternalistic eye, as if to say, \"Welcome to the club.\"\nIn many Western European countries, domestic terrorism has been a fact of life for decades, whether from the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Irish Republican Army in Britain, Basque separatists in Spain, the Mafia in Italy, Algerians in France or one of the many other groups seeking violent publicity for their causes and grievances. Cities like Beirut and Belfast have become synonyms for political violence, and many nations, like Israel, have learned to live under constant threat.\nRooted in such a background, many comments in the foreign press focused on America's loss of innocence. \"Whatever happens, one conclusion is already clear,\" Le Monde of France said in an editorial. \"The United States is no longer impervious to that urban terrorism which their West European allies have known for a long time.\"\nAlong with expressions of sympathy came somewhat more testy reminders that the United States could hardly regard itself as less violent than the rest of the world. If Americans have tended to view terrorism as a foreign phenomenon, they noted, much of the rest of the world has often seen the United States as a nation that indulged a passion for guns and an addiction to violence.\nRussians commonly blame the proliferation of American movie violence for the spread of crime and street violence, and American incursions into Grenada and Panama prompted many European commentaries on the tenacity of the \"cowboy mentality\" in American foreign policy.\n\"The fact is that America is dominated by an excess of violence and that conflicts there are far too often resolved with weapons,\" Stuttgarter Zeitung in Germany editorialized.\nFrom a Third World perspective, Cairo's Al Akhbar el Yom expressed the hope that Oklahoma City would serve as a lesson in humility for the powerful states: \"No longer will the great powers be able to reprimand small countries and complain that their measures to contain terrorism violate human rights.\"\nIndeed, the central question in the aftermath of the Oklahoma blast was how far the world's leading democracy was prepared to curtail civil liberties to combat terrorism. It was a question many other major democracies had already been forced to confront, and many had responded with legislation that nudged up against, or breached, the canons of civil and human rights, usually with the reluctant consent of their populations.\nBritain's long struggle with the Irish Republican Army calmed after a cease-fire last Aug. 31, but the legacy is bitter. Since it first sent troops into Northern Ireland to counter the militant nationalists of the I.R.A. in 1969, the British Government has tried a variety of measures, with varying degrees of effectiveness.\nIt made even membership in the I.R.A. a crime, and Northern Irish courts were authorized to dispense with juries and the usual rules of evidence in the trials of terrorists. For several years in the early 1970's, I.R.A. suspects could be interned indefinitely without trial, and after that provision was lifted, they could still be held up to a week without being formally charged.\nMost of the measures were limited to Northern Ireland, but a large bomb explosion in England in 1974 led to the passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which the Government itself described as \"Draconian\" but necessary. Since then, 35 people have been killed in the 20 most serious attacks, and mainland Britons have learned to live with roadblocks, bomb threats, impromptu searches and barricades.\nOne of the more curious measures was a law passed in 1988 that allowed I.R.A. spokesmen to be seen on television, but not heard. Thus Gerry Adams would be seen speaking, but his words would be spoken by an actor or written out in subtitles. The law was believed to derive from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's abhorrence for the voices of the nationalists, and with Mrs. Thatcher no longer in office, it was recently dropped.\nIn West Germany, the rise of the fanatic Red Army Faction in the late 1960's and the attack by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972 challenged the resistance to a strong national police force that had originated in the abuses of the Nazi era. In 1973, the elite federal police group known as GSG-9, or Grenzschutzgruppe-9, was set up to respond to airplane hijackings and other acts of terror.\nMost German laws draw no distinction between terrorists and other criminals, but a few special measures have been enacted. A law passed in 1976 made membership in a group that had been declared terrorist punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and several Red Army members were imprisoned this way.\nThe German police have been empowered to tap the phones of suspected terrorists and to open their mail, and prosecutors have the power to reduce the sentences of terrorist suspects who cooperate with investigators. Other measures bar any contact among jailed terrorists and provide for the Government to monitor their meetings with lawyers. Prison wardens are authorized to place convicted terrorists under surveillance and to separate them from visitors with glass partitions.\nLike Germany, Japan has been reluctant to give excessive powers to the police, but unlike Germany, it has not been pressured to do so. The only direct consequence so far of the recent poison gas attacks in Japan has been to ban the nerve gas sarin. Otherwise, there is no anti-terrorism law, and laws on surveillance and wiretapping are generally vague.\nBattered by Middle Eastern terrorists in the 1980's, France responded with a variety of special measures. One of them recently backfired when Prime Minister Edouard Balladur came under fire for authorizing a wiretap against the relative of a judge investigating the finances of Mr. Balladur's party.\nThe bombing in Oklahoma City, despite the enormous damage and carnage, did not represent the sort of pervasive threat that much of Europe has faced.\nBut if in the past the United States was prone to remind the Old World about the primacy of human rights over security, the veterans of terrorism in the Old World seemed to feel it was now their turn to issue some reminders to America.\nWriting in Liberation in Paris, the columnist Jacques Amalric raised the hope that Americans \"would come to question the virtues ascribed to isolationism, that chronic disease of the United States, which supposedly protects them from the evils of the world.\"\nIn London, The Guardian asserted, \"Beefing up the F.B.I. is not the real answer to the sickness of American society.\"\nThe Schwaebische Zeitung in Germany editorialized, \"Controlling enemies must not bring a return to the McCarthy era, when Communists in the United States were hunted like wild animals.\"\nAnd The Economist of England proclaimed, \"The dangers of government acting too strongly may be greater than the dangers of failing to act.\"",

        "Topic": "1998: The launch of the International Space Station",
        "Title": "Space Station's First Construction Crew Lifts Off Aboard the Shuttle - The New York Times",
        "Content": "The planet's most daring construction job began today as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first American-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion.\nAfter a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launching went off flawlessly at 3:36 this morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star.\nOn their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new American module. Wielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically in the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedrals look like child's play.\nProjections are that the job will require 160 space walks, which, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. When complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power arrays, is to cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules of interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile.\nThe project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site.\nThe work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money.\nThe Russians, whose participation in the partnership cinched the post-cold-war deal five years ago, are now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have left Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology.\nAt the same time, the station's costs are rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will consume their own Federal financing. The project's total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers are to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners about $14 billion.\nIn exchange, mankind hopes for a grand laboratory where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remaining mysteries, in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other worlds.\nToday, in any case, little was heard about the project but praise.\n''Great show, Endeavour,'' mission control in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into orbit.\nAnd here at the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright lauded the launching team and the new venture.\n''That was truly, truly fantastic,'' she told the team after the liftoff. And it is important, she added, to have so many nations ''working together on the kinds of issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with.''\n''So my congratulations to all of you,'' the Secretary said. ''Stupendous work.''\nThe main cargo today was the Unity module, the first American-built part for the space station. Small compared with the giants to come in three dozen shuttle flights during assembly, the unit is 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules.\nOn Saturday, one astronaut, Lieut. Col. Nancy J. Currie of the Army, is to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position.\nThen, on Sunday, the astronauts are to rendezvous with the module known as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States but built in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, is to be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion as well as communication and rendezvous abilities.\nWhen Endeavour's payload bay is within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. The mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big. Zarya, although completely weightless in space, has 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill.\nAs Colonel Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert D. Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space flights, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together.\nWhen mated with special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to the tips of the solar arrays.\nStarting Monday, a pair of space-walking astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future visitors. The builders are to be Col. Jerry L. Ross of the Air Force, 50, and Dr. James H. Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space walks will continue on Wednesday and end on Saturday, Dec. 12.\nAs construction goes on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy making preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system.\nNext Thursday the crew will enter the embryonic station for the first time, installing portable fans and lights. On Friday they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia.\nThe other astronauts on Endeavour are its pilot, Maj. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of the Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new outpost, the crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days.\nGretchen W. McClain, NASA's director in Washington for the international space station, said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small for individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's 96 million taxpayers.\nAmerican costs for construction, she added, are $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 are $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion.\nMost experts outside the agency consider that figure ridiculously low, because it ignores many billions of dollars spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights, which run about $800 million apiece.\nIn a report on May 22, the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, estimated the American share of the construction cost at $53 billion and of total cost at $96 billion, including operations but not including the cost of decommissioning by sending the station plummeting into the ocean. (NASA has no estimate of that cost so far.)\nAdded to that are the contributions of the international partners, like the $6.7 billion from the European Space Agency and an amount from Russia that is still uncertain because of Moscow's financial turmoil.\nOver all, experts put the estimated cost at no less than $110 billion, adding, however, that it could well be higher and that only time will tell.\n''It's more than the Manhattan Project but less than Apollo,'' said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. The Manhattan Project, to build the atom bomb, cost about $20 billion in today's dollars, he said, and the Apollo program, which repeatedly put men on the Moon, about $125 billion.\nMr. Pike backs the station as smart politically if it helps stabilize Russia. But many scientists fault it as an enormous waste of money, saying its huge costs and growing budget overruns have already hurt NASA programs and are destined to spread pain further.\nIn the current issue of Sky and Telescope, a top astronomy magazine, Leif J. Robinson, the editor, strongly criticized America's killing the half-built superconducting supercollider, an $8 billion project meant to illuminate the building blocks of matter, but backing the international space station, or I.S.S., which Mr. Robinson ridiculed as a ''flying fiasco.''\nMaybe the atom smasher's ghost, he wrote, ''will rise up and drag the I.S.S. down to the hell it deserves.''\nBackers hail the outpost as a foreign-policy coup and a steppingstone to human exploration of Mars and more distant worlds, saying its studies of human physiology are a must for learning how people can venture far from Earth.",

        "Title": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Investigators Hunting for 3 Suspects as Conspirators in World Trade Center Bombing - The New York Times",
        "Content": "The authorities are searching for at least three more suspects in the bombing of the World Trade Center and believe they narrowly missed arresting one of them on Friday, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.\nAlong with two men already under arrest, the three were said to be listed on records of a Jersey City storage locker where chemicals believed to match used in the bomb were found.\nNew Jersey officials confirmed that an intense search was under way for at least one other man who was seen with the two bombing suspects now in custody, Mohammed A. Salameh and Nidal A. Ayyad, in the days just before the explosion, when a yellow rental van believed to have carried the bomb was seen around the storage locker. Authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that on Friday, they had gone to a place where they believed the man would be, but failed to find him. Blizzard Hampering Search\nThe blizzard sweeping through the region was hampering the hunt for the three, one senior official acknowledged, but he said Federal surveillance teams were in place throughout the region \"so if they show up they won't walk away.\"\nOf the three, the one authorities have come closest to finding is named Mahmoud, officials in the investigation confirmed after the name was obtained from an acquaintance not involved in the investigation. The officials declined to identify any of the others.\nRamadan Hammouda, a Brooklyn businessman who travels to and from the Middle East, said the man he knew as Mahmoud used to visit someone in his building, but Mr. Hammouda said he did not know him and did not know why he was being sought.\nSeveral investigators described the three being sought as important members of what they are calling a conspiracy, possibly people who helped devise the plot. \"There are probably more significant people who haven't been arrested than have been,\" one investigator said.\nInvestigators said that while Mr. Salameh and Mr. Ayyad were tied to the bombing through the van and the chemicals, their ineptness in evading detection suggested a conspiracy in which others masterminded the attack.\nAuthorities tracing wire transfers of funds from Germany into a bank account shared by Mr. Salameh and Mr. Ayyad and other accounts maintained by Mr. Salameh said they were also investigating other traces of financial backing that could shed light on the motive for the bombing -- so far undetermined. There were other signs of progress in the investigation two weeks after the blast in the trade center's underground parking garage that killed at least five people, wounded more than 1,000 and knocked out the city's tallest office towers for weeks. Meeting Secretly Taped\nAn official said that a meeting between Mr. Salameh and El Sayyid A. Nosair in Attica state prison had been surreptitiously recorded by the authorities and that the audio tapes were being reviewed for any information they might provide about the bombing.\nMr. Nosair was acquitted of the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 but convicted of assault and gun charges. As a relative of a man whose address Mr. Salameh carried on his driver's license when he rented the van believed used to carry the bomb, Mr. Nosair has come under intensive new scrutiny. The police said last week that they were reopening their investigation into the Kahane shooting to see whether it might have involved a conspiracy or whether it could shed any new light on the bombing.\nBoxes of personal papers and other material seized from residences in New Jersey and Brooklyn listed by Mr. Salameh have been sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation laboratory in Washington for analysis. The search yielded documents in Arabic, photographs, fingerprints, traces of explosive materials and bank records linking Mr. Salameh to Mr. Ayyad that are helping establish the trail of the money found in their bank accounts, officials in Washington said.\nRobert E. Precht, Mr. Salameh's public defender, acknowledged that his client had received wire transfers from abroad. But he said they had come from family members -- in one case from a relative, a physician in Germany -- and that they were of a \"totally innocent\" nature. Web of Aliases\nInvestigators say they have enountered a web of suspicious aliases and apparent \"safe houses\" used by Mr. Salameh and others.\nRomeo Mondero, of 2 Holly Court in Middlesex, N.J., owns 40 Pamrapo, the house in Jersey City where F.B.I. agents found splash marks indicating some experimentation with corrosive if not explosive chemicals.\nMr. Mondero said that he recognized Mr. Salameh from pictures as being the man he rented the house to under the name of \"Alaa Mahrous.\" He said he saw Mr. Salameh on three occasions, and only on one occasion saw another person whom he could not identify.\nThey rented the apartment for Jan. 1, he said, paid one month's rent and one month's security, gave notice on Feb. 1 that they would leave by the end of the month, and they did so, using the security deposit to pay the rent. The rent was $550 a month.\nInvestigative officials said they had not yet established who had driven the van into the garage but had some theories that they declined to discuss.\nThey said that through some receipts they they had traced some of the chemicals found in the storage locker to purchases from a supplier in New Jersey. But they declined to say who had made the purchases or from where.\nInvestigators said thay had also located and seized two rental cars believed used by Mr. Salameh and Mr. Ayyad, a red Corsica and a red Ciera. The cars were seen by Employees at the Ryder van leasing office in Jersey City when the two men made several trips in connection with the rental of the van days before the bombing.\nTo speed the exchange of information in the investigation, a computer link was put in place last week between the Manhattan office of James M. Fox, the F.B.I. head in New York, and his counterpart in Newark, Jim Esposito.",

        "Topic": "2018: The historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump",
        "Title": "Trumps Promises to Kim Jong-un Leave U.S. and Allies Scrambling - The New York Times",
        "Content": "WASHINGTON  President Trump praised the strongman tactics of North Koreas leader, Kim Jong-un, and dismissed American military exercises with South Korea as a waste of money on Friday, as his administration and allies scrambled to accommodate the presidents promises to Mr. Kim after their historic summit meeting this week.\nThe Pentagon and Seoul moved toward canceling a large-scale and long-planned military exercise that was set for August, Defense Department officials said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up days of talks with top officials in South Korea, Japan and China, where he sought to maintain American steadfastness in the region.\nIn a Friday morning interview on the White House lawn, Mr. Trump echoed what his critics have said: That his meeting in Singapore would elevate Mr. Kims status as a credible world leader. By Mr. Trumps telling, it was part of a strategy to lower tensions with North Korea.\nI went there, I gave him credibility, Mr. Trump said. I think its great to give him credibility.\nDuring the interview, with Fox and Friends, the president also called Mr. Kim the strong head of North Korea. He speaks and his people sit up at attention, Mr. Trump said. I want my people to do the same.\nAsked to clarify his comments about people sitting up, Mr. Trump later said he was kidding. But they served as a striking reminder of the presidents budding admiration for Mr. Kim, a 34-year-old dictator who ordered the killing of his uncle and presides over a government that has brutalized and impoverished its people.\nAs Mr. Trump savors the afterglow of his meeting with Mr. Kim, he has left it to the Pentagon and the State Department to pick up the pieces on military planning and diplomacy.\nOfficially, planning for the Ulchi Freedom Guardian military exercise, one of the worlds largest, is still moving ahead. But American military officials quietly sent a much smaller delegation than originally expected to an organizational meeting this week in Seoul, after Mr. Trumps surprise announcement in Singapore that he was ending joint military exercises as an inducement for North Korea.\nIt costs us a lot of money, Mr. Trump said on Friday. I saved lot of money. Thats a good thing for us.\nAfter the summit meeting, Mr. Trump characterized the annual exercises as very provocative  a description that aligns with North Koreas views and sharply deviates from his own Defense Department. The Pentagon has long insisted that the exercises are not meant to provoke North Korea; rather, military officials said, they underline American commitment to its allies in the region and seek to ensure that South Korea, in particular, will be able to defend itself.\nDefense Department officials said on Friday that they expected an announcement, most likely next week, that the Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise will either be canceled or be scaled back sharply. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his South Korea counterpart, Song Young-moo, discussed canceling the exercises during a telephone call on Thursday, said a Defense Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made.\nOfficials in Seoul have also strongly indicated that the exercise will be suspended, with President Moon Jae-in agreeing to be flexible as long as North Korea stays engaged in dialogue and starts moving toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program. That comment was widely taken as endorsing Mr. Trumps decision to end the exercises on the same conditions.\nPublicly, the Pentagon has said only that Mr. Mattis reaffirmed the ironclad alliance with South Korea. Pentagon officials said Mr. Mattis made similar reassurances by phone on Thursday to Japans defense minister, Itsunori Onodera.\nMr. Pompeo was returning to Washington on Friday after nearly a week of clarifying Mr. Trumps intentions after the Singapore meeting. In Seoul on Thursday, for example, Mr. Pompeo played down the presidents claim that North Korea no longer represented a nuclear threat.\nWhen he talked about the reduction in nuclear threat, Mr. Pompeo said, it was with eyes wide open. He added that it could be the case that our effort will not work, but we are determined to set the conditions.\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump told journalists that he would speak this weekend to diplomats about the path forward in the nuclear talks. He angrily denied that he failed to extract concessions from Mr. Kim about how swiftly North Korea would surrender its nuclear arsenal, or how the United States could verify its disarmament.\nThe Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise last year ran for 11 days, and involved 17,500 American forces, including about 3,000 from outside the peninsula, and 50,000 South Korean troops. The exercise includes computer simulations carried out in a large bunker south of Seoul intended to check the allies readiness to repel aggressions by North Korea.\nIt is possible that the event this year would be contained to so-called tabletop exercises, which would be less visible but stop short of a cancellation. Two Defense Department officials said the large-scale performances of war-fighting skills  including naval warships and high-profile maneuvers  are all but certain to not happen this year.\nHowever, the officials said, it is also possible that even the low-key tabletop exercises will be too much for Ulchi Freedom Guardian in August. Mr. Trumps assertion that he was canceling war games, the officials said, makes it hard to carry out the exercise in any form without the risk of Mr. Kim accusing the United States of not keeping its word.\nThe big question then becomes what happens to other exercises, after Ulchi Freedom Guardian, the officials said.\nYou could probably cancel a single major exercise, like this one, without doing major damage to the alliance and its readiness, said Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center.\nBut that cannot become the standard, Mr. Daly said. You have to do joint exercises for the 32,000 American military in Korea to have strategic meaning.\nIf several major war games were canceled for more than a year, the impact could be significant, the officials said.\nWere generally fine to miss a single exercise, even one of this magnitude, said Kathleen Hicks, a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration. Strategically, however, it will worry Japan in particular and allies in Europe who will wonder what and how much were willing to give away.\nOn Capitol Hill, some leading Republicans echoed that sentiment.\nYouve got to give these negotiations every opportunity to succeed, Representative Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican who leads the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters this week.\nAs long as the negotiations are being productive, these particular joint exercises that were planned for August, O.K., well, this is an opportunity to hold their feet to the fire and see if North Korea is serious about this, Mr. Thornberry said. If theyre not serious, then its pretty easy to say those joint exercises that were scheduled for August are now going to happen in September or October.\nDiplomats who have worked on North Korea said Mr. Trumps new warmth toward Mr. Kim eased months of tension between the two leaders that, in the past, would have made negotiations all but impossible. But it also reduces the leverage that American negotiators have to pressure the North to give up its nuclear weapons.\nIn a new propaganda film, Pyongyang seized on the meeting to showcase the warm reception that the North Korean leader received in Singapore.\nThe streets were overflowing with people adoring our great leader, who is driving complex international politics with supernormal political acumen, said the 42-minute documentary, which was released by North Koreas state broadcaster.\nNorth Koreas extravagant coverage of the meeting, said Joseph Y. Yun, a former State Department official who negotiated with North Korea, suggested that Mr. Kim might want a different relationship with the United States. But that does not mean he is willing to give up his weapons.\nI dont think our side has recognized that the price is gone up, Mr. Yun said. Were going to have to pay more to get smaller concessions.",

        "Content": "TOKYO  At least 45 tons of highly radioactive water have leaked from a purification facility at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, and some of it may have reached the Pacific Ocean, the plants operator said Sunday.\nNearly nine months after Fukushima Daiichi was ravaged by an earthquake and tsunami, the plant continues to pose a major environmental threat. Before the latest leak, the Fukushima accident had been responsible for the largest single release of radioactivity into the ocean, threatening wildlife and fisheries in the region, experts have said.\nThe new radioactive water leak called into question the progress that the plants operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, appeared to have made in bringing its reactors under control. The company, known as Tepco, has said that it hopes to bring the plant to a stable state known as a cold shutdown by the end of the year.\nThe trouble on Sunday came in two stages, a Tepco statement said. In the morning, utility workers found that radioactive water was pooling in a catchment next to a purification device; the system was switched off, and the leak appeared to stop. But the company said it later discovered that leaked water was escaping, possibly through cracks in the catchments concrete wall, and was reaching an external gutter. \nIn all, as much as 220 tons of water may now have leaked from the facility, according to a report in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun that cited Tepco officials.\nThe company said that the water had about one million times as much radioactive strontium as the maximum safe level set by the government, but appeared to have already been cleaned of radioactive cesium before leaking out. Both elements are readily absorbed by living tissue and can greatly increase the risk of developing cancer. \nTepco said a check on Saturday had found no sign of the leak, suggesting that it began Saturday night or early Sunday morning. The company said it was exploring ways to stop any more water from escaping. \nSince the disaster in March, workers have been struggling to cool the stricken plants reactors by flooding them with water, which is contaminated with radioactivity in the process and becomes a problem of its own. \nTepco installed a new circulatory cooling system in September with filters that decontaminate and recycle the cooling water. But the company acknowledges that some water has already leaked into the ocean, and thousands of tons of water remain in the flooded basements of the plants reactor buildings.\nThe Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety in France estimates that between March and mid-July, the amount of radioactive cesium 137 that had leaked into the Pacific from the Fukushima Daiichi plant amounted to 27.1 petabecquerels, the greatest amount known to have been released from a single episode. (A becquerel is a frequently used measure of radiation, and a petabecquerel is a million billion becquerels.) ",

        "Title": "REAGAN SAYS HE WILL PRAY FOR THE POPE - The New York Times",
        "Content": "President Reagan, still recovering from wounds inflicted by an assassin six weeks ago, was informed immediately of the shooting of Pope John Paul II.\n''I'll pray for him,'' the deputy White House press secretary, Larry Speakes, reported him as having said. Minutes later, the President phoned Terence Cardinal Cooke in New York to express his dismay. The Cardinal promised to convey his message to the Vatican.\nPoliticians and religious leaders here expressed shock and outrage over what a hastily approved Senate resolution called ''the latest act of violence to stain our time.'' 'Still Very Concerned'\nThe United States has no formal diplomatic relations with the Vatican, but the Pope has a personal representative, or Apostolic Delegate, in Washington. The delegate, Archbishop Pio Laghi, said this afternoon that although the Pope was ''in satisfactory condition'' after surgery ''we are still very concerned.''\nStanding beneath a huge portrait of Pope Pius X in the delegation's sedate building here, the Archbishop said he was unable to shed any more light on the situation than was available from news reports. He called on all Americans, Roman Catholics and others, to ''join me in wishing to our Beloved Holy Father John Paul II a speedy recovery.'' He added, ''We need him.''\nAssistants of Archbishop Laghi said that the delegation had been flooded with calls of sympathy from all over the country, including one from the White House.\nArchbishop John Roach of St. Paul-Minneapolis, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued a statement through the conference's headquarters in Washington. 'Profound Sense of Shock'\n''I feel a profound sense of shock that the Prince of Peace has been felled by an assassination attempt,'' the Archbishop said. ''Once more the tragic spiral of violence that has so often engulfed the world has reached out to harm not just the leader of the church but all persons of decency and good will.\n''I pray to God that Pope John Paul II will be restored to full health and vigor so that he can continue his providential leadership of the church and his determined quest for peace on earth.''\nThe Senate stood silent for a minute and then heard its chaplain offer a prayer for the Pope's recovery. The Senators then approved unanimously by voice vote a resolution saying that ''we join now in common concern and we pause in prayer to God for the life, the health, and the recovery of John Paul II.''\nThe resolution was introduced by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. The text was sent to the Apostolic Delegation for transmission to Rome. Bush Denounces Terrorism\nMost reaction here was limited to such general expressions of regret since there was no immediate word on the motive for the shooting. Responding to questions from reporters after he addressed a group of award winners in the East Garden of the White House, Vice President Bush denounced international terrorism.\nAlthough he said it was not yet known if the Vatican shooting constituted political terrorism, he said ''to the degree terroristic actions internationaly kind of condition society for this kind of thing, it's unacceptable.''\nNews of the shooting came as the President's wife, Nancy, was preparing to give a lunch for Senate wives. The lunch was held, but the planned entertainment by five members of the 1980 Olympic gymnastics team was canceled. Mrs. Reagan's news secretary described her as being ''very upset'' by the news.\nAfter the wounding of Mr. Reagan on March 30, the Pope sent a message to the President that said, in part, ''I join in denouncing all manifestations of violence and terrorism and every act that violates human dignity in any individual.''",

        "Title": "Annan Urges Formation of War Crimes Court - The New York Times",
        "Content": "Warning that the eyes of past and future victims ''are fixed upon us,'' the United Nations Secretary General today urged establishment of a global war crimes court as a ''bulwark against evil.''\nThe Secretary General, Kofi Annan, opened a five-week conference here to develop rules for a permanent tribunal that could prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity. He urged the delegates, from 156 nations, to take a firm stand: ''I trust you will not flinch from creating a court strong and independent enough to carry out its task. It must be an instrument of justice, not expediency.''\nBut just how strong and independent such a court will be is one of the critical issues to be decided.\nThe United States wants to limit the court's jurisdiction. Washington is concerned that unless the Security Council has a say in what crimes are brought to trial, American soldiers around the globe could be prosecuted on politically motivated charges.\nBut such traditional American allies as Britain and Canada say the court should work as independently as possible and are leading a coalition of 40 to 50 nations, the ''like-minded group,'' that want to minimize Security Council involvement.\nBefore hunkering down in private to debate more than 400 disputed articles in the draft, the two sides moved quickly today to stake claims in the battle for public opinion.\nThere is broad consensus that the court should be called in only when national courts are unable or unwilling to act, and only for the gravest of crimes, like genocide and civilian massacres.\nResponding to the systematic use of sexual assault in wars in the Balkans and Rwanda, the court is expected to include rape as a recognized war crime for the first time, alongside torture, prisoner abuse and violence against civilians.\nSupport is not quite as widespread for a provision mandating the court to prosecute crimes committed during internal conflicts, which account for 90 percent of the victims of war today. Some states argue that the court should only investigate crimes in conflicts between nations. These arguments are viewed as fatally obstructionist by human rights groups.\nFrance, for example, is leading an effort to require the court to obtain a nation's consent before investigating crimes committed by its leaders or soldiers. Rights groups have denounced that proposal as tantamount to destroying the court's credibility.\nCanada, which holds the chairmanship of the conference, has warned that members of the ''like-minded group'' might walk away from a treaty rather than allow it to be watered down.\n''We want to make it very clear to those who are trying to compromise down to the lowest common denominator that they have no chance,'' warned the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy. Having no court ''is better than a Potemkin village.''\nBoth Mr. Axworthy and Mr. Annan cited the treaty to ban the use of land mines as a promising precedent to build popular support for the court.\nLast year more than 120 nations signed a treaty to ban the production and use of anti-personnel land mines in a conference in Ottawa that was organized outside United Nations channels. The United States, Russia and China did not sign the treaty.\nHinting at the way the United States was isolated on the land-mine issue, Mr. Annan told reporters, ''No one country, I hope, will want to be responsible for the failure of this conference.''\nMr. Axworthy said that in terms of public relations, the court would be a harder sell than the ban on land mines. ''On land mines, we had Princess Diana looking at broken children in Angola,'' he explained. ''The court is more abstract; people don't get as excited by legal issues, especially where lawyers are concerned.''",

        "Title": "THE LAST HOURS OF FLIGHT 007: RETRACING THE FATEFUL NIGHT OVER SAKHALIN - The New York Times",
        "Content": "On the morning of Sept. 1 a Korean Air Lines jetliner with 269 people aboard, on a flight from New York to Seoul by way of Anchorage, flew over Soviet territory and was shot down by an SU-15 fighter.\nFollowing is a chronology of Flight 007 in Greenwich mean time, giving the source of the information in capital letters. American revisions of transcripts of the Soviet pilots' radio transmissions were made available on Sept. 11. 1258:36 - JAPAN: The Anchorage tower clears Korean Air Lines Flight 007, with 240 passengers and 29 crew members, for takeoff on Runway 32 for its flight to Seoul. 1328:06 - JAPAN: Flight 007 makes a routine report.\n1345:00 - SOVIET: Russians first detect the presence of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane. UNITED STATES: An RC-135 was on a routine surveillance mission monitoring Soviet compliance with strategic arms limitation agreements. SOVIET: Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, chief of the Soviet General Staff, said the plane ''spent two hours here carrying out a somewhat strange patrol.'' 1432:21 - JAPAN: The first of five efforts by the Anchorage traffic center to reach Flight 007 is made. 1435:11 - JAPAN: Another Korean Air Lines jet, Flight 15, forwards the position of K.A.L. 007, saying it is now at an early checkpoint along airway Red 20, which takes jetliners within 50 miles of Soviet territory. 1551 ** - SOVIET: The Soviet Air Defense Force says it detects another aircraft in the area and at roughly the same height as the RC-135. 1600:46 - JAPAN: The second Korean jetliner, Flight 15, relays another position report for 007. 1600 ** - SOVIET: The 747 and the RC-135 rendezvous and cause a ''total convergence of the blips on the radar screen.'' The two planes fly side by side for about 10 minutes. UNITED STATES: Washington has denied that the planes flew beside each other and has said they were 75 nautical miles from each other at their closest point of approach. 1610 (estimated) - SOVIET: The Soviet Air Defense Force said it observed one of the planes turning back and flying to Alaska ''while the second aircraft went straight for Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka.'' The Russians determined that the plane continuing toward Soviet territory was on a reconnaissance mission. 1630 (estimated) - SOVIET: The Korean airliner flies over a ''strategic nuclear base'' on Kamchatka and does not respond to inquiries from Soviet control services. ''Attempts to contact the plane at a fixed international frequency'' were made and, because there was no response, the decision was made to ''force the plane to land on the nearest airfield.'' 1709 ** - JAPAN: The 747 makes a routine position report to Tokyo. 1802 ** - SOVIET: Flight 007 sharply alters its course and approaches positions of an Air Defense Forces base. ''There was no doubt then,'' Marshal Ogarkov said, that the airliner was a reconnaissance plane. 1806:00 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 that eventually shot down the 747 radioes back to ground control that he is ''flying behind'' the airliner. 1808:48 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of one of the Soviet MIG-23 fighters trailing the airliner radioes to ground control that he ''needs to drop his wing tanks,'' a customary maneuver before engaging in combat. 1809:00 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 says the airliner ''has turned'' and now ''is 80 degrees to my left.'' 1812 ** - JAPAN: The Japanese Air Self-Defense Forces radar station at Wakkanai suddenly sights an aircraft flying southwest over Sakhalin Island about 100 miles north of Wakkanai. Japanese officials said later that there was no way that the radar station could have known that the plane was Flight 007. The 747 was sighted as an ''unidentified aircraft.'' 1812:10 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 radioes that he sees the 747 ''visually and on radar.'' 1812:41 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the MIG-23 says he has dropped his wing tanks. 1813:05 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 repeats that he sees the airliner and adds, in a reference to his missile, ''I'm locked on to the target.'' 1813:26 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 says the airliner ''isn't responding to I.F.F.,'' a reference to ''Identify, Friend or Foe,'' a military communication to identify a friendly plane. 1813:35 - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the SU-15 says the jetliner's course is 240 degrees. 1813:40 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter pilot says his weapons system ''is turned on.'' 1815 ** - JAPAN: Flight 007 requests permission to raise its altitude from 33,000 feet to 35,000 feet. 1815:47 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter pilot confirms, ''I am in lock-on.'' 1816:46 - UNITED STATES: The jetliner remains on the same course. 1818:34 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter pilot says that the 747's air navigational lights ''are burning'' and that the strobe light ''is flashing.'' SOVIET: The 747 is flying without navigation lights. 1819:02 - UNITED STATES: ''I am closing on the target,'' the pilot of the SU-15 says. 1819:08 - UNITED STATES REVISION: ''They do not see me,'' the fighter pilot says. 1820:08 - UNITED STATES: ''Fiddlesticks!'' the Soviet fighter says. ''I'm going.'' He says his missile warheads are already locked on. 1820:10 - JAPAN: Tokyo traffic controllers clear Flight 007 to climb to a level of 35,000 feet. 1820:20 - JAPAN: Flight 007 confirms that it will climb to 35,000 feet. 1820:22 - UNITED STATES: The SU-15 pilot says he needs to approach the 747. 1820:30 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter pilot turns off his missile ''lock on'' and is ''approaching the target.'' 1820:49 - UNITED STATES REVISION: The pilot of the fighter plane reports to ground control that he is ''firing cannon bursts.'' SOVIET: The pilot fired 120 tracer shells as a warning to the 747 and, Marshal Ogarkov said, ''The intruder did not react.'' 1821 (estimated) - UNITED STATES: The pilot of the second Soviet fighter, the MIG-23, tells ground control that he cannot see the target. 1821:24 - UNITED STATES: ''I'm approaching the target,'' the SU-15 pilot says. ''I'm going in closer.'' 1821:35 - UNITED STATES: The SU-15 pilot makes another reference to the 747's strobe light and says he has approached the target as close as 1.2 miles. 1821:55 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter pilot asks for instructions. 1822:02 - UNITED STATES: The fighter pilot tells ground control that the 747 ''is decreasing speed.'' SOVIET: The 747 drops its wing flaps in a deliberate effort to slow down and thus to avoid the Soviet fighters. 1822:17 - UNITED STATES: The pilot says he is going around the 747. ''I'm already moving in front of the target,'' he says. 1822:23 - UNITED STATES: The SU-15 increases speed, perhaps in an effort to circle past the 747 and to get behind it so it can fire its missiles. 1822:29 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet pilot repeats that the 747 is decreasing its speed. 1822:42 - UNITED STATES: ''How can I chase it?'' the Soviet pilot asks. ''I'm already abeam of the target.'' 1822:55 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet pilot tells ground control that he has ''to fall back a bit from the target.'' 1823:05 - JAPAN: The Korean airliner makes a routine transmission without indicating that it knows of the presence of the Soviet fighters or of the cannons. 1823:37 - UNITED STATES REVISION: ''I'm dropping back,'' the Soviet pilot says. ''Now I will try rockets.'' 1824 ** - SOVIET: Soviet air defenses give a command to ''stop the flight over the territory of the Soviet Union.'' 1825:46 - UNITED STATES: The SU-15 reports that its missile warheads are locked on. 1826:20 - UNITED STATES: ''I have executed the launch,'' the Soviet fighter pilot says, apparently referring to his missiles. 1826:22 - UNITED STATES: ''The target is destroyed,'' the SU-15 pilot says. 1826:27 - UNITED STATES: The Soviet fighter breaks off the attack. 1826:58 - JAPAN: Flight 007 sends an identification call to Narita International Airport in Japan, ''Tokyo, Korean Air 007.'' 1827:10 - JAPAN: Flight 007 says, ''KE007'' but the signal was, according to the transcript, ''noisy and weak.'' At this time, the pilot, in a voice that displays great tension, also says that he has lost ''all engines'' and that the jetliner is suffering ''rapid decompression.'' 1828:12 - JAPAN: Narita places the first of seven calls to Flight 007, without response. 1830 ** - UNITED STATES: Radar shows Flight 007 at 16,400 feet. 1834:37 - UNITED STATES: Soviet MIG-23 pilot asks for further instructions. 1835 (estimated) - UNITED STATES: A third Soviet fighter pilot asks, ''Do you see the target?'' 1836 (estimated) - UNITED STATES: The third Soviet fighter pilot says he does not see the 747. 1838 ** - UNITED STATES: Flight 007 drops from radar screens. 1838:37 - UNITED STATES: ''I don't see anything in this area,'' the pilot of the MIG-23 says. ''I just looked.'' 1911 ** - SOVIET: Dawn over Sakhalin.",

        "Title": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW; KOSOVO TALKS BREAK DOWN AS SERBS BALK OVER DETAILS; NATO WILL STEP UP BOMBING - The New York Times",
        "Content": "After two days of tense negotiations, talks between NATO and Yugoslav military commanders broke down early this morning over how and when Serbian forces would withdraw from Kosovo, throwing into doubt the peace deal reached last week by political leaders.\nThe main stumbling block appeared to be the Serbian demand that the United Nations Security Council first approve a peacekeeping force before NATO troops enter Kosovo. Serbian officials also objected to several details of the withdrawal plan itself, which they said impinged on Yugoslav sovereignty.\nBoth sides said they would be willing to meet again, but said they would not resume talks here tomorrow. They gave no indication of what must change in order for talks to continue. In the meantime, officials said, NATO would intensify its bombing of Yugoslavia.\nNATO officials presented the Yugoslav delegation with a six-page, ''nonnegotiable'' document on Saturday outlining the terms for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army and Serbian paramilitary and police forces from Kosovo. It also covered NATO's entry to establish and maintain peace in the province, where Serbian forces engineered the worst mass deportation in Europe since World War II.\n''Our job has been to translate the political agreement into a workable military reality on the ground,'' Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the commander of NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping force, said in a statement read under klieg lights at a French air base here about 3 A.M.\n''The Yugoslav delegation presented a proposal that would not guarantee the safe return of all the refugees or the full withdrawal of Yugoslav forces,'' he added.\nClinton Administration officials said the breakdown was a sign that the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, was unwilling to abide by the terms of a peace agreement he accepted last week. [Page A10.]\nGeneral Jackson said NATO had ''no alternative but to continue and indeed intensify the air campaign until such time as the Yugoslav delegation is prepared to implement the agreement, and without ambiguity.''\nBoth General Jackson and the Yugoslav delegation presented the setback as a conflict over the agreement reached in Belgrade last week by Mr. Milosevic, a special Russian envoy and the President of Finland.\nIn Washington, the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H. Bacon, said, referring to the group of world's top industrial powers and Russia: ''We will continue to work with our NATO allies and the G-8 to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, the air campaign will continue.''\nNebojsa Bujovic, a Deputy Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, spoke immediately after the British general, and said the NATO proposal raised questions about ''the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo is an integral part.''\nMr. Bujovic said Yugoslavia interpreted the agreement to require ''deployment of an international security presence under the auspices of the U.N. or a presence established under a Security Council mandate.''\nAfter 10 weeks of the air campaign, NATO dramatically reduced its bombing missions against Yugoslavia after last week's agreement. With the failure to settle how that accord should be carried out, NATO made clear that it would step up the air attacks that have already devastated much of Yugoslavia's infrastructure in an attempt to stop the explusion of Albanians from Kosovo.\nThroughout the day on Sunday, NATO spokesmen underlined that the air war would be considered a success only when all of the hundreds of thousands of Albanians who became refugees in the last few weeks are returned.\nThe Yugoslav delegation raised four major points on Sunday that they said made it difficult to sign the agreement, according to a NATO official. Above all, they said, they could not withdraw within seven days as stipulated, asking for an extension of two weeks.\n''There are an awful lot of little details to settle,'' said Lieut. Col. Robin Clifford, the spokesman for NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping force. ''Vehicles broken down, shortage of fuel, and roads that are impassable.''\nThe Yugoslav delegation also said that they would need more than 48 hours to remove the antiaircraft defense system in Kosovo, according to a NATO official, and that they wanted mines cleared by NATO, not by their own forces.\nIn discussing those and other differences, NATO officials acknowledged that they were making changes in the ''nonnegotiable'' agreement.\n''There may well be changes in words and phrases to make sure the points are clear,'' Colonel Clifford said. ''But there will be no changes in the substance.''\nIncluded in the questions under negotiation as the session entered its 13th hour were the number of Serbian policemen to be allowed in Kosovo after the initial withdrawal and whether the Serbs would accept the buffer zone between Kosovo and its border with Montenegro and Serbia, according to a NATO official.\nAlso at issue, according to NATO officials, was the size of any Russian contingent in the peacekeeping force and where it would be deployed. Russia has proposed that its troops be concentrated along the northern sector of Kosovo, a proposal that NATO rejected for fear that it would lead to the partition of the province.\nDuring the talks, a NATO spokesman described the discussions as ''very professional.'' NATO officials had expected the session to be a short one.\nThe talks, which began on Saturday, had been suspended overnight after the two sides reached agreement on all but ''only one or two minor details,'' Colonel Clifford said. They agreed to move their discussions to this French air base here because of its modern communications and spacious meeting rooms inside the base's portable hangar.\nThe 17 hours of talks included a 13 member Yugoslav delegation headed by Lieut. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, the Deputy Chief of Staff of Mr. Milosevic's armed forces, who was absent from the first round of talks.\nThe delegates arrived by car and helicopter. Sitting on one side of the negotiating table were the three Yugoslav negotiators: Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, the deputy chief of staff of Yugoslav Armed Forces; Col. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic, representing the Ministry of Interior, and Lieut. Gen. Blagoje Kovacevic, of the Yugoslav Army.\nAcross from them was General Jackson, who was be NATO's sole signer of the document.\nThe first sign of what would become an impasse was the arrival around noon of two officials on General Jackson's staff carrying maps and briefcases filled with material on the agreement.\nThe Yugoslav delegation then asked that a Russian official take part as an observer in the meeting.\nTwo hours later, a NATO official announced a two-hour break to allow the Yugoslavs to ''reassess their position.'' And soon afterward, Col. Carmine De Pasquale, the head of the Italian brigade of the Kosovo peace force, said: ''Problems have cropped out that can only be resolved by the President of Yugoslavia.''",

        "Topic": "1982: The Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom",
        "Title": "BRITISH BLOCKADE AROUND FALKLANDS GOES INTO EFFECT - The New York Times",
        "Content": "Britain imposed a blockade around the Falkland Islands this morning, ready to sink any Argentine warship that came closer than 200 miles to the disputed archipelago.\nBut there were no reports of naval engagements in the South Atlantic in the first hour, and it appeared increasingly unlikely that the Argentine fleet intended to enter the forbidden area, where British submarines were lurking, waiting to intercept and attack any potential targets.\nAlthough the risk of an imminent clash between the two navies in the South Atlantic seemed to have receded, there was no hard evidence of progress on the underlying dispute over ownership of the islands. Haig Returns to London\nSecretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. returned to London from Buenos Aires at dawn, ready to resume his peacemaking mission. He was scheduled to hold a series of meetings a few hours after his Air Force jet touched down at Heathrow Airport after the 18-hour journey.\nThe blockade, which went into effect at 11 P.M., New York time, had been announced four days ago. It began as scheduled with the issuance of a confirming order from British naval headquarters at Northwood, outside London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. A ministry statement said earlier that all major Argentine warships except one destroyer and one frigate had returned to port.\nJust a few hours before Britain made good its threat to cut the sea lanes linking the Falklands with the Argentine coast 250 miles away, Francis Pym, the Foreign Secretary, reiterated Britain's threat to fire first and ask questions later. But he preferred not to ''talk in terms of naval battles,'' he said in a radio interview, because he expected Argentine ships to avoid the war zone around the islands, which Britain held from 1833 until Argentine troops seized control on April 2. 'Moving in Right Direction'\n''If there is going to be some arrangement by diplomatic means to settle this dispute,'' he declared, ''I would not expect there to be any targets within that zone. In view of the fact that Mr. Haig is making these efforts, which we totally support, I think it would be very surprising indeed if there were targets in the exclusion zone.''\nThe opposition Labor Party's chief spokesman on foreign affairs, Denis Healey, said he detected ''many signs that things are moving in the right direction.'' He suggested that the United States might be about to propose that administration of the Falklands be taken over by the United Nations or the Organization of American States.\nBoth men appeared to believe that Mr. Haig's return to London, where he was expected to arrive shortly after daybreak, meant he had persuaded the Argentine junta to avoid providing any targets for the British at least until he had had a chance to speak again with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr. Haig said in Buenos Aires before he departed that he had ''some ideas and certain proposals that we will discuss'' with British leaders. Submarine Known to Be in Area\nBut there was no direct confirmation, either in London or in Buenos Aires, that the junta had agreed to pull all of its ships out of the exclusion zone. At least one British nuclear submarine, the Superb, equipped with Tigerfish homing torpedoes, is known to be in the area, and it is thought that as many as three of her sister ships are also there.\nSome military experts said they thought a stalemate might be developing, in which the Argentine fleet would wait outside the 200-mile limit while Argentine troops, perhaps as many as 8,000 to 9,000 of them, remained on the Falklands, resupplied and reinforced by air.\nFailing a diplomatic solution, events would then presumably await the arrival in the South Atlantic of the 27-ship British battle fleet, with its jet fighter-bombers and helicopters, about 10 days from now.\nIn that situation, Britain would have achieved the technical aim of the blockade - cutting the Falklands off from reinforcement by sea - but it would be no closer to regaining control of the islands. Two Vessels 'Still at Sea'\nThe Defense Ministry statement, made about 18 hours before the blockade was to go into effect, said that Argentina's only aircraft carrier, its only cruiser, seven of its eight destroyers, two of its three frigates and all of its submarines ''are back in port.'' A ministry spokesman declined to discuss the position of the other destroyer and the other frigate except to declare that ''they are still at sea.''\nOther sources said the frigate was on its way back to port from the South Georgia island group, a dependency about 800 miles east of the Falklands, where it was damaged in fighting with British marines.\nIt was not known whether any Argentine naval supply ships were in the forbidden area. Argentina also has a number of fast small attack craft, including two built in West Germany in 1974 and two built in the United States in 1946. They are capable of speeds up to 40 knots. Pictures of these boats, supposedly operating off the Falklands, were shown on Argentine television last week, but the Defense Ministry spokesman suggested that the pictures were actually taken near the mainland.\n''We believe that their patrol boats do not have the sea-keeping abilities to reach the Falkland Islands except in very calm weather,'' the spokesman said. ''We do not have calm weather at the moment.'' British Flotilla 'on Time'\nThe ministry said the main British flotilla, whose exact location was classified information, was ''on course and on time.'' He confirmed that the Peninsular and Oriental luxury liner Canberra, now a troop carrier hurrying south toward a rendezvous with the flotilla, was being trailed by a newly built Soviet spy ship, the 3,400-ton Primorye.\n''We would expect this kind of surveillance,'' he commented. Another passenger ship belonging to the same company, the 16,907-ton liner Uganda, has also been commandeered. Now in the Mediterranean with 940 children on board for an educational cruise, she is to put her passengers ashore at Naples on Tuesday, then head for Gibraltar to be fitted out as a hospital ship.\nThe proposal for an international peacekeeping force that would administer the Falklands on an interim basis might well be acceptable to the Argentines, judging from statements by members of the junta over the last week, and Mr. Pym said on television Sunday that the Government had not closed its mind to a solution of that sort. Withdrawal Demanded\nBut before any such agreement can be discussed, ''before there can be anything remotely like negotiations,'' Mr. Pym said once again, ''the condition for us is that they withdraw first.'' The Argentine Government has suggested that it would considering pulling its troops back only if the British fleet turned back.\nMr. Pym categorically rejected the suggestion that the impasse might be broken if Mrs. Thatcher agreed to recall the fleet in return for an Argentine promise to evacuate the troops from the Falklands.\nThe Prime Minister, who has been monitoring the crisis from her official country residence at Chequers, 35 miles northwest of London, attended Easter services at a 13th-century Anglican church in the village of Ellesborough in Buckinghamshire.\nLater she returned to 10 Downing Street to prepare for another round of negotiations with Mr. Haig beginning at midmorning. She immediately went into a meeting with Mr. Pym and with John Nott, the Minister of Defense, to review the developments of the last 48 hours.",

        "Topic": "2015: The Paris Agreement on climate change",
        "Title": "Leaders Move to Convert Paris Climate Pledges Into Action - The New York Times",
        "Content": "PARIS  Before the applause had even settled in the suburban convention center where the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus on Saturday night, world leaders warned that momentum from the historic accord must not be allowed to dissipate.\nToday, we celebrate, said Miguel Arias Caete, the European Unions energy commissioner and top climate negotiator. Tomorrow, we have to act.\nWith nearly every nation on Earth having now pledged to gradually reduce emissions of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet  a universal commitment that had eluded negotiators and activists since the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  much of the burden for maintaining the momentum shifts back to the countries to figure out, and carry out, the concrete steps needed to deliver on their vows.\nThe task may prove most challenging for India, which is struggling to lift more than half of its population of 1.25 billion out of poverty and to provide basic electricity to 300 million of them. But rich countries are intent that India not get stuck on a coal-dependent development path.\nIt is essential that the developing countries are able to transform their energy system before they develop a level of dependence on coal that we have in the industrialized countries, said Jan Burck of the activist group Germanwatch.\nDuring negotiations, India insisted that it would not be able to make the transition without assistance. There will have to be new mechanisms, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar of India told reporters after the agreement was adopted.\nChina, meanwhile, is investing so heavily in clean energy that some observers think its carbon emissions might have hit a peak  a milestone that China had promised to reach only by 2030.\nIts top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, said Saturday that China will actively implement its nationally determined contributions so as to reach a peak as soon as possible, but privately its officials have expressed pride that it no longer has the coal-stained reputation it had at the Copenhagen climate talks of 2009.\nGiza Gaspar Martins, an Angolan diplomat who represents the Least Developed Countries, which negotiated in Paris as a bloc, said of the accord: This puts a system in place to do climate action, but we will have a lot of work to do.\nHe said the pledges were designed to emphasize participation rather than ambition, but now we have to make sure our national contributions are aligned with what the scientists tell us we need to be doing.\nLeaders here agreed that while legislation and regulation are essential to set the ground rules for the marketplace, the goal of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will require accelerated research and investment, and technological breakthroughs.\nBy calling  albeit indirectly, and in delicately worded phrases  for net carbon emissions to be effectively brought down to zero in the second half of this century, the Paris Agreement could mark the beginning of the end of the fossil-fuel era, as Marcelo Mena Carrasco, a Chilean biochemical engineer and climate negotiator, put it.\nThat is certainly the hope of the Obama administration. Secretary of State John Kerry said the American government had helped catalyze the agreement by toughening fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, cracking down on emissions from coal-fired power plants, and reaching a deal with China, the only country that emits even more greenhouse gases than the United States.\nPresident Obama has endorsed the idea of a price on carbon  in the form of a tax, or a cap-and-trade system like Californias  and leaders of Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, France, Germany and Mexico endorsed the idea at the start of the Paris conference. But there was not nearly enough support to incorporate it into the Paris Agreement.\nWhile attention is shifting to the marketplace, the United Nations process will move ahead. The Paris Agreements provisions will not kick in until 2020. Indeed, though adopted by consensus, no nation has signed it yet. Countries will be invited to do so in a ceremony at the United Nations in New York on April 22; the agreement officially will take effect after at least 55 countries, representing at least 55 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, have signed on.\nThe United States will be one of them; through careful legal craftsmanship, the Paris Agreement will not be considered as its own treaty under American law but rather as an extension of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which the Senate ratified in 1992.\nThe United Nations has several short-term priorities. One is to get the remaining countries that have not submitted emissions-reduction pledges to do so. Venezuela and St. Kitts and Nevis submitted their plans on Saturday, bringing the total to 188.\nBy May, the United Nations climate staff will update its estimate for the combined impact of the national pledges (now known as nationally determined contributions, the qualifying word intended having been dropped). Estimates of the first round of pledges suggested that, if carried out, they would still result in a rise of 2.7 to 3.5 degrees Celsius (4.9 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels  far above the newly adopted goal of just 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nThose national plans must be revised every five years. Also every five years, starting in 2018, the United Nations will take stock of the pledges to see how much progress has been made in the aim of reaching peak carbon emissions as soon as possible and limiting temperature rise.\nThe Paris Agreement also strongly urges rich countries, which in 2009 pledged to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poorer countries mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, to scale up their commitment. The agreement calls for a new financial goal  with $100 billion a year as the minimum  to be agreed upon by 2025.\nA Green Climate Fund, established by 194 countries in 2013 to invest in technology, said on Saturday that it had raised $6.5 billion out of a total of $10 billion pledged last year. The Global Environment Facility, a fund established in 1992 for the Earth Summit meeting, announced $250 million in new financing for the least developed countries. The Paris Agreement urges additional support for both funds.\nBut as the Paris Agreement is put into place, the front lines of the battle to stabilize the planets atmosphere will shift elsewhere. At the start of the talks, 20 governments pledged to double spending on clean-energy research and development over the next five years, while a coalition of business leaders led by Bill Gates vowed to invest billions on developing renewable energy.\nMany governors, mayors and other leaders of subnational governments have announced their own commitments to reducing emissions  including one effort led by Michael R. Bloomberg, the United Nations special envoy for cities and climate change, and one headed by California and the German state of Baden-Wrttemberg.\nGov. Jerry Brown of California and Winfried Kretschmann, president of Baden-Wrttemberg, convened in Paris during the talks to attract more supporters. You have to do many different things and each place its different, said Mr. Brown, a Democrat. It is a process of shifting and balancing and it takes a lot of people.\nClimate activists have long used a power of the people approach to promote sustainability and organize globally, and the world leaders who met here credited civil society for keeping up the pressure.\nNow the work to hold them to their promises begins, the American environmentalist and activist Bill McKibben wrote on Twitter, moments after the gavel fell on the Paris Agreement. 1.5?

A network user is as likely to encounter Julie McKibben, a fifth grader in Phoenix, or Danielle Doucette, a high school student who numbers cheerleaders and athletes among her friends in Waldwick, N.J., as to find Ben Kotcher, a 16-year-old computer expert in Reading, Ohio.\nNor are these all children of affluence. Granted, it is probably more likely for a child to become a networker if Mom or Dad uses a home PC to do the taxes or if the hottest new Apple Macintosh Quadra happens to be in the den. But many children are introduced to network computing through school or special programs, like the summer camp at Phoenix College that brought Julie McKibben on-line.\nThe simple fact is anyone today who is under age 18 has never known a world without personal computers. And the technology is unfolding in ways more meaningful, and much less passive, than the televised global village that was held out as the information-age ideal to an earlier generation.\nThanks to interactive computer networks offering games, bulletin boards and chat groups, a virtual neighborhood is taking shape.\n\"These children are pioneering the creation of a new kind of public space that you and I don't understand yet,\" said Zane Vella, a New York computer researcher who is developing a computer outpost called Cityspace where children can visit on Internet.\nCall it the Digital Hangout.\nDanielle Doucette, the New Jersey high school student, has found the computer networks a perfect way to extend her social world. Each evening she spends about an hour on a commercial network called the Imagination Network, \"chatting\" via her keyboard with teen-agers all over the country. For $12.95 a month, she gets 30 hours of evening and weekend use on the Imagination Network, which is operated by Sierra On-Line Inc. of Oakhurst, Calif.\n\"I've met a lot of my friends this way,\" she said. \"It's different from real life because you're not inhibited; people can say whatever they like. You can be more open and less shy.\" On-Line Flirtations\nDanielle said she had an on-line boyfriend in California for several months, but she ended the electronic flirtation when he announced that he wanted to come east for a visit. \"That would have been just too hard,\" she said.\nMany computer experts, and young networkers, too, say the networks have made computing a more social experience, helping end the stereotype of the pimple-faced boy who forsakes people and sunshine to sit alone before the cold glow of a video monitor.\n\"Computer networks offer a powerful tool for cutting across gender lines and making computers attractive to girls in ways that weren't possible before,\" said Mitchel Resnick, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory.\nAnd, because most of the systems are text-only, there is an emphasis on the written word that would gladden any English teacher's heart. From Port Arthur, Jon Leger's network travels led him to a community college president in Silicon Valley who corrects his on-line grammar. Using Network at Camp\nJon spent many days this summer helping elementary schoolchildren like the fifth grader Julie McKibben at the summer camp in Phoenix create word-only computer games, after he electronically stumbled upon the youngsters while wandering the network. (To keep a promise, he stayed up until 4 A.M. one night finishing the design for a keyboard volleyball game for his young, unseen friends. \"Spike!\" a player must type, to send a screamer over the net; \"dig!\" the opponent must respond, if he or she has any hope of saving the point.)\nThe Phoenix summer camp was run for a group of 27 elementary students with learning difficulties from low-income families. Each day, Julie and the others spent as much as three hours on-line, typing instructions and reading from computer screens, whether corresponding with electronic pen pals like Jon Leger, or using word descriptions to create elaborate fantasy worlds on a type of network known as a Muse, for multi-user simulation environments.\n\"It was real fun,\" Julie recalled in a telephone interview. \"I made a stable with 32 stalls and a bale of hay in each stall. I made a horse named Claudia that was white with a mane as black as midnight.\" She said she and her classmates had also worked with other children on the network to create a textual description of Europe that they could then \"tour.\" Bridging Technology Gap\nThe summer project exceeded the teachers' hopes. \"It was a miracle,\" said Billie Hughes, an education professor at Phoenix College. \"These kids sat down and read and wrote for three hours, and they didn't want to go away. They were hooked.\"\nTeachers, computer experts and sociologists view the emergence of computer networks not only as a way to motivate underachievers but also as a lifeline that can bridge the technology gap between rich and poor children.\n\"This is a refuge for the kids because their family life in the world outside is extremely violent in all senses,\" said Ann Jocknick, director of Computers and You, a computer education center for children in the Tenderloin district, a low-income, high-crime section of San Francisco. \"This is a safe space to come in and explore and take risks, and a lot of children really blossom here.\"\nThe international links that computer networks create offer a particularly compelling avenue for broadening students. One of the first was created in 1990 by Odd de Presno, a Norwegian computer journalist, who set up a nonprofit organization called Kidlink. In its three years, Kidlink has connected more than 10,000 children in more than 50 countries. Link to Cape Canaveral\nEarlier this month, for example, Jamie Wilkerson, a fifth-grade teacher at Rosewood School in Rock Hill, S.C., used Kidlink to lead a computer discussion of a planned space shuttle launching. From a computer keyboard at Cape Canaveral, she narrated the event, including the dramatic shutdown of the engines just seconds before launching. Sending questions and receiving answers were her students in Rock Hill, as well as several dozen children from six other countries.\nIt was hardly the first time Mrs. Wilkerson's students had logged on with her. \"We have accessed more information in one year through the network, than I could ever get my children to see in a library or in textbooks,\" she said.\nBut understand, despite such lofty uses of computer networking, the youth of America are still, well, the youth of America.\nBen Kotcher, a high school junior in the Cincinnati suburb of Reading, Ohio, thanks the network for expanding his social circle. \"I have close friends in Massachusetts who I know as well as my friends here in Cincinnati,\" he said. \"The hardest thing is that I can flirt with girls, but I can't go out with them. I guess networks aren't a replacement for the real world.\"",

        "Topic": "2007: The subprime mortgage crisis escalates",
        "Title": "Mortgage Crisis Spirals, and Casualties Mount - The New York Times",
        "Content": "Even in affluent Orange County, Calif., the growing wealth of executives and brokers in the booming mortgage industry was hard to miss.\nFor Kal Elsayed, a former executive at New Century Financial, a large lender based in Irvine, driving a red convertible Ferrari to work at a company that provided home loans to people with low incomes and weak credit might have appeared ostentatious, he now acknowledges. But, he says, that was nothing compared with the private jets that executives at other companies had. \nYou just lost touch with reality after a while because thats just how people were living, said Mr. Elsayed, 42, who spent nine years at New Century before leaving to start his own mortgage firm in 2005. We made so much money you couldnt believe it. And you didnt have to do anything. You just had to show up.\nJust as the technology boom of the late 1990s turned twenty-something programmers into dot-com billionaires, and leveraged buyouts a decade earlier turned Wall Street bankers into Masters of the Universe, the explosive growth in subprime lending turned mortgage bankers and brokers into multimillionaires seemingly overnight. \nNow an escalating crisis in the market, which seemed to reach a new crescendo late last week, is threatening a wide band of people. Foremost are the poor and minority homeowners who used easy credit to buy houses that are turning out to be too expensive for them now that mortgage rates are going up, but the pain is also being felt widely throughout the business world. \nLarge companies that bought subprime lenders during the boom, like H&R Block and HSBC, are now scrambling to sell them or scale back their exposure. Many investors are also likely to suffer: Wall Street firms made billions in fees, commissions and trading revenue from packaging and selling subprime mortgages to them as bonds.\nNew Century has emerged as a poster child for the lenders that rode that boom to the top and are now in free fall. The company disclosed on Friday that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating stock sales and accounting errors. The latter could jeopardize billions of dollars in financing for the company, which issued $39.4 billion in subprime loans in the first nine months of last year.\nWeakening home prices and rising default rates have rocked the subprime business. But for those who cashed out before the market turned, the ride up was particularly sweet. The three founders of New Century, for example, together made more than $40.5 million in profits from selling shares in the company from 2004 to 2006, according to an analysis by Thomson Financial. They collected millions of dollars more in dividends, salaries, bonuses and perks. \nThe company said in a statement yesterday that the founders were still significant shareholders, noting that they collectively owned about 7 percent of the company at the end of last year. \nNew Centurys stock price, which seemed to mirror the trajectory of the subprime business, peaked at nearly $66 a share in December of 2004 and traded in the $40s most of last year; on Friday, it was trading at $11 a share after the market closed. In a series of sales from August to November, two of the companys founders sold shares for an average price of about $40 a share, for a total profit of $21.4 million.\nIt is not known whether the stock sales by the founders are among the sales being examined by federal investigators. Some of them had been part of scheduled stock sales that are often used by executives to diversify their portfolios. But some of the sales occurred on the same day that the executives entered the plans. A New Century spokeswoman, Laura Oberhelman, said that executives declined further comment. \nThe founders stock also rose in the social circles of southern California, the epicenter of the boom in subprime. Five of the 10 biggest providers of subprime mortgages last year had their headquarters in the region. \nRobert K. Cole, 60, a co-founder who retired as chairman and chief executive last year, lives in a 6,100-square-foot oceanfront home in Laguna Beach that is valued at tens of millions of dollars and was once owned by the chief executive of Pimco Advisors, the giant bond trading and management firm. Edward F. Gotschall, 52, another co-founder who is vice chairman of the board, donated $3 million for an expanded trauma center at Mission Hospital that will be named for him and his wife Susan. \nThe executives from New Century are by no means alone in cashing in on the bonanza, and they do not appear to have scored the biggest profits. That title may be claimed by Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the nations largest stand-alone mortgage company and one of the largest subprime lenders last year. He reaped more than $270 million in profits from sales of stock and the exercise of stock options from 2004 to the start of this year, according to the Thompson analysis. \nOf course, most of the 500,000 people who work in the mortgage industry did not cash in so grandly. The wealth was concentrated among executives, loan officers and brokers, because the greatest rewards were meted out in the form of commissions, bonuses and stock awards. \nIn the hot times, it was not unusual to see a broker make a million bucks, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. You can carry that up further to people who ran the companies. The whole business revolves around personal compensation.\nThe hot times are clearly over.\nNew Centurys disclosure of the federal investigations on Friday was the most serious in a string of shocks to have rocked the industry in the last three months. \nA handful of lenders have sought bankruptcy protection, several have been acquired and a few have been shut down. Also on Friday, Fremont General, a top-five lender, said it planned to leave the business. \nIndustry officials say they are seeing an exodus of executives and salespeople as companies fold, cut jobs and push out early leaders. \nEveryone has run for the hills, said William D. Dallas, whose company, Ownit Mortgage, filed for bankruptcy protection in December after it lost financing from Merrill Lynch and other banks. \nFor the borrowers of these mortgages, it may become more difficult to refinance if lending standards are tightened significantly. Many are already facing the prospect of payment shock when low, fixed-interest mortgage rates adjust to higher, variable rates. \nOn Wall Street, big investment banks could lose a significant source of revenue if the appetite for bonds backed by mortgages dries up. \nIn the last two years many skeptics began warning that the red-hot housing market and adjustable-rate loans would blend into a toxic brew. Last year, subprime loans totaled $600 billion, or about 20 percent of all mortgages, up from $120 billion and 5 percent in 2001, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. More than half of subprime loans have adjustable rates. \nMany of the problems that have surfaced thus far are not tied to the resetting of rates. Rather, they stem from a sharp and early spike in the default rates among loans issued last year.\nFor example, about 13.8 percent of the loans in a group of mortgages New Century sold to investors in April were behind in payments or in foreclosure by January. By comparison, only 6 percent of loans in a pool sold to investors in March 2005 had met that same fate by January 2006. \nInvestors and regulators fear that the problems will only worsen as so many borrowers have fallen behind so quickly, especially at a time when the overall economy is healthy. The phenomenon suggests that lending standards were significantly weakened last year and that lenders were not as watchful for fraudulent transactions. \nFor New Century, the early payment defaults pose significant financial problems. In the first nine months of last year, Wall Street banks and investors that it does business with forced it to buy back $469 million in loans it had sold to them, up from $240 million for the same period in 2005. \nThe company was able to sell back about half of those loans at a discount of 26.5 percent. How it handled the remainder  about $227 million  is now under scrutiny. According to accounting rules the company should have valued the loans on its books for what they were worth today, not their previous face value. But it did not. \nIf it had, the company would have seen its earnings fall by about $60 million before taxes, wiping out most of its profit in the third quarter, according to Zach Gast, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensic accounting firm. \nThis is important, because the companys financing agreements require that it not lose money for any rolling six-month period. On Friday, New Century said it did not expect to make a profit in the six months that ended in December and that it was negotiating with lenders to waive the requirement but has only secured six of 11 waivers it needs. \nThey had losses sitting on their balance sheets, Mr. Gast said.\nIn August, the companys chief financial officer, Patti M. Dodge, announced she was stepping down from her post to oversee investor relations, a department that typically reports to the chief financial officer. Taj S. Bindra, a former executive at Washington Mutual, replaced her in November. \nFor the second time in a decade, New Century finds itself fighting to survive. The firms roots were planted at Plaza Home Mortgage Bank where the three founders of New Century  Mr. Cole, a longtime mortgage executive; Mr. Gotschall; and a lawyer named Bradley A. Morrice  worked together. The three formed New Century in 1995 after Plaza was sold to Fleet Mortgage Group, now a part of Washington Mutual. \nIn the late 1990s, New Century narrowly survived accounting concerns and a scare in the bond market after Russia s default in 1998. It pulled through thanks to an investment by U.S. Bancorp, a bank based in Minneapolis.\nWith interest rates at historic lows, it quickly grabbed a big share of the fast-growing subprime market during the housing boom.\nThey walked into a niche industry at a time when everything was lining up perfectly for what they did, said W. Scott Simon, a managing director at Pimco Advisors. In 2001, 2002 and 2003 the subprime business was just phenomenally profitable. Home prices kept appreciating and it seemed that no loans ever went bad.",

        "Topic": "2013: Pope Francis is elected as the first Latin American Pope",
        "Title": "Cardinals Elect Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina as New Pope - The New York Times",
        "Content": "VATICAN CITY  With a puff of white smoke from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and to the cheers of thousands of rain-soaked faithful, a gathering of Catholic cardinals picked a new pope from among their midst on Wednesday  choosing the cardinal from Argentina, the first South American to lead the church.\nThe new pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (pronounced Ber-GOAL-io), will be called Francis, the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. He is also the first non-European pope in more than 1,200 years and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church.\nIn choosing Francis, 76, who had been the archbishop of Buenos Aires, the cardinals sent a powerful message that the future of the church lies in the global south, home to the bulk of the worlds Catholics.\nI would like to thank you for your embrace, the new pope, dressed in white, said from the white balcony on St. Peters Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below. My brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away, but here I am.\nSpeaking in Italian as he blessed the faithful, Francis asked the audience to pray for me, and well see each other soon.\nGood night, and have a good rest, he concluded, in a grandfatherly, almost casual tone.\nHabemus papam! members of the crowd shouted in Latin, waving umbrellas and flags. We have a pope! Others cried, Viva il Papa!\nIt was like waiting for the birth of a baby, only better, said a Roman man, Giuliano Uncini. A child sitting atop his fathers shoulders waved a crucifix.\nFrancis is known as a humble man who spoke out for the poor and led an austere life in Buenos Aires. He was born to Italian immigrant parents and was raised in the Argentine capital.\nThe new pope inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during his predecessor, Benedict XVI, including a shortage of priests, growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere, a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the churchs moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself.\nBenedict abruptly ended his troubled eight-year papacy last month, announcing he was no longer up to the rigors of the job. He became the first pontiff in 598 years to resign. The 115 cardinals who are younger than 80 and eligible to vote chose their new leader after two days of voting.\nPope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict on Wednesday evening, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. He called it an act of great significance and pastorality that Francis first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor.\nThe Rev. Thomas Rosica of Canada, another Vatican spokesman, recalled meeting Cardinal Bergoglio a decade ago during preparations for World Youth Day in Canada, and said the cardinal had told him that he lived very simply, in an apartment Buenos Aires, and sold the archdioceses mansion.\nHe cooks for himself and took great pride in telling us that, and that he took the bus to work rather than riding in a car, Father Rosica said.\nPresident Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the popes humble roots and New World background.\nAs a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than 2,000 years  that in each other we see the face of God, Mr. Obama said in a message released by the White House.\nAs the first pope from the Americas, the president added, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day.\nA doctrinal conservative, Francis has opposed liberation theology, abortion, gay marriage and the ordination of women, standing with his predecessor in holding largely traditional views.\nAs archbishop of Buenos Aires beginning in 1998 and a cardinal since 2001, he frequently tangled with Argentinas governments over social issues. In 2010, for example, he castigated a government-supported law to legalize marriage and adoption by same-sex couples as a war against God.\nHe has been less energetic, however, in urging the Argentine church to examine its own behavior during the 1970s, when the country was consumed by a conflict between right and left. In what became known as the Dirty War, as many as 30,000 people were disappeared, tortured or killed by a military dictatorship that seized power in March 1976.\nIn a long interview with an Argentine newspaper in 2010, Cardinal Bergoglio defended his behavior during the dictatorship. He said that he had helped hide people being sought for arrest or disappearance by the military because of their political views, had helped others leave Argentina and had lobbied the countrys military rulers directly for the release and protection of others.\nBefore beginning the voting by secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel on Tuesday, in a cloistered meeting known as a conclave, the cardinals swore an oath of secrecy in Latin, a rite designed to protect deliberations from outside scrutiny  and to protect cardinals from earthly influence as they seek divine guidance.\nThe conclave followed more than a week of intense, broader discussions among the worlds cardinals about the problems facing the church and their criteria for its next leader.\nWe spoke among ourselves in an exceptional and free way, with great truth, about the lights but also about shadows in the current situation of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Christoph Schnborn of Vienna, a theologian known for his intellect and his pastoral touch, told reporters this week.\nThe popes election is something substantially different from a political election, Cardinal Schnborn said, adding that the role was not the chief executive of a multinational company, but the spiritual head of a community of believers.\nIndeed, Benedict was selected in 2005 as a caretaker after the momentous papacy of John Paul II, but the shy theologian appeared to show little inclination toward management. His papacy suffered from crises of communications  with Muslims, Jews and Anglicans  that, along with a sex abuse crisis that raged back to life in Europe in 2010, evolved into a crisis of governance.\nCritics of Benedicts secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said he had difficulties in running the Vatican and appeared more interested in the Vaticans ties to Italy than to the rest of the world. The Vatican is deeply concerned about the fate of Christians in the war-torn Middle East.\nThe new pope will also inherit power struggles over the management of the Vatican bank, which must continue a process of meeting international transparency standards or risk being shut out of the mainstream international banking system. In one of his final acts as pope, Benedict appointed a German aristocrat, Ernst von Freyberg, as the banks new president.\nFrancis will have to help make the Vatican bureaucracy  often seen as a hornets nest of infighting Italians  work more efficiently for the good of the church. After years in which Benedict and John Paul helped consolidate more power at the top, many liberal Catholics also hope that the new pope will give local bishops conferences more decision-making power to help respond to the needs of the faithful.\nThe reform of the Roman Curia, which runs the Vatican, is not conceptually hard, said Alberto Melloni, the author of numerous books on the Vatican and the Second Vatican Council. its hard on a political front, but it will take five minutes for someone who has the strength. You get rid of the spoil system, and thats it.\nThe hard things are if you want a permanent consultation of bishops conferences, he added.\nFor Mr. Melloni, foreign policy and the churchs vision of Asia would be crucial to the new pope. If Roman Catholicism was capable of learning Greek while it was speaking Aramaic, of learning Celtic while it was speaking Latin, now it either has to learn Chinese or ciao,' he said, using the Italian world for goodbye.\nAhead of the election, cardinals said they were looking for a pope that understands the problems of the church at present and who is strong enough to tackle them, said Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the archbishop emeritus of Prague, who participated in the general congregations but was not eligible to vote in a conclave.\nHe said those problems included reforming the Roman Curia, handling the sex abuse crisis and cleaning up the Vatican bank.\nHe needs to be capable of solving these issues, Cardinal Vlk said as he walked near the Vatican this week, adding that the next pope needs to be open to the world, to the troubles of the world, to society, because evangelization is a primary task, to bring the Gospel to people.\nThe sexual abuse crisis remains a troubling issue for the church, especially in English-speaking countries where victims sued dioceses found to have moved around abusive priests.\nOn Wednesday, news reports in California showed that one cardinal elector, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the former archbishop of Los Angeles; the archdiocese; and a former priest had reached a settlement of almost $10 million in four child sex abuse cases, according to the victims lawyers.\nBecoming pope also has a human dimension. In one of his final speeches as pope before he retired on Feb. 18, Benedict said his successor would need to be prepared to lose some of his privacy.",

        "Topic": "2015: The discovery of liquid water on Mars",
        "Title": "Ancient Mars Had an Ocean, Scientists Say - The New York Times",
        "Content": "After six years of planetary observations, scientists at NASA say they have found convincing new evidence that ancient Mars had an ocean.\nIt was probably the size of the Arctic Ocean, larger than previously estimated, the researchers reported on Thursday. The body of water spread across the low-lying plain of the planets northern hemisphere for millions of years, they said.\nIf confirmed, the findings would add significantly to scientists understanding of the planets history and lend new weight to the view that ancient Mars had everything needed for life to emerge.\nThe existence of a northern ocean has been debated for decades, but this is the first time we have such a strong collection of data from around the globe, said Michael Mumma, principal investigator at NASAs Goddard Center for Astrobiology and an author of the report, published in the journal Science. Our results tell us there had to be a northern ocean.\nBut other experts said the question was hardly resolved. The ocean remains a hypothesis, said Ashwin Vasavada, project scientist of the Curiosity rover mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\nDr. Mumma and Geronimo Villanueva, a planetary scientist at NASA, measured two slightly different forms of water in Mars atmosphere. One is the familiar H2O, which consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\nThe other is a slightly heavier version of water, HDO, in which the nucleus of one hydrogen atom contains a neutron. The atom is called deuterium.\nThe two forms exist in predictable ratios on Earth, and both have been found in meteorites from Mars. A high level of heavier water today would indicate that there was once a lot more of the lighter water, somehow lost as the planet changed.\nThe scientists found eight times as much deuterium in the Martian atmosphere than is found in water on Earth. Dr. Villanueva said the findings provide a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had by determining how much water was lost to space.\nHe said the measurements pointed to an ancient Mars that had enough water to cover the planet to a depth of at least 137 meters, or about 450 feet. Except for assessments based on the size of the northern basin, this is the highest estimate of the amount of water on early Mars that scientists have ever made.\nThe water on Mars mostly would have pooled in the northern hemisphere, which lies one to three kilometers  0.6 to 1.8 miles  below the bedrock surface of the south, the scientists said.\nAt one time, the researchers estimated, a northern ocean would have covered about 19 percent of the Martian surface. In comparison, the Atlantic Ocean covers about 17 percent of Earths surface.\nThe new findings come at a time when the possibility of a northern ocean on Mars has gained renewed attention.\nThe Curiosity rover measured lighter and heavier water molecules in the Gale Crater, and the data also indicated that Mars once had substantial amounts of water, although not as much as Dr. Mumma and Dr. Villanueva suggest.\nThe more water was present  and especially if it was a large body of water that lasted for a longer period of time  the better the chances are for life to emerge and to be sustained, said Paul Mahaffy, chief of the atmospheric experiments laboratory at the Goddard Space Flight Center.\nJust last month, the science team running the Curiosity rover held its first formal discussion about the possibility of such an ocean and what it would have meant for the rest of Mars.\nScientists generally agree that lakes must have existed for millions of years in Gale Crater and elsewhere. But it is not clear how they were sustained and replenished.\nFor open lakes to remain relatively stable for millions of years  its hard to figure how to do that without an ocean, Dr. Vasavada said. Unless there was a large body of water supplying humidity to the planet, the water in an open lake would quickly evaporate and be carried to the polar caps or frozen out.\nYet climate modelers have had difficulty understanding how Mars could have been warm enough in its early days to keep water from freezing. Greenhouse gases could have made the planet much warmer at some point, but byproducts of those gases have yet to be found on the surface.\nJames Head, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University, said in an email that the new paper had profound implications for the total volume of water on ancient Mars.\nBut, he added, climate models have great difficulty in reconstructing an early Mars with temperatures high enough to permit surface melting and liquid water.\nAlso missing are clear signs of the topographic and geological features associated with large bodies of water on Earth, such as sea cliffs and shorelines.\nBased on low-resolution images sent back by the Viking landers, the geologist Timothy Parker and his colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab reported in 1989 the discovery of ancient shorelines. But later high-resolution images undermined their conclusions.\nStill, Dr. Parker and his colleagues have kept looking for  and finding, they say  some visible signs of a northern ocean. The new data certainly encourages me to do more, he said in an interview.\nOther researchers have also been looking for signs of an ancient ocean.\nIn 2013, Roman DiBiase, then a postdoctoral student at the California Institute of Technology, and Michael Lamb, an assistant professor of geology there, identified what might have been a system of channels on Mars that originated in the southern hemisphere and emptied steeply into the northern basin  perhaps, they said, water flowing through a delta to an ocean.",

        "Title": "Mandela Set No Conditions For Release, an Aide Insists - The New York Times",
        "Content": "A senior official of the African National Congress said today that the organization's jailed leader, Nelson Mandela, had set no conditions for his release and that, as far as Mr. Mandela was concerned, ''he should have come out a long time ago.''\nPress reports from South Africa quoted Winnie Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader's wife, as saying after a meeting with her husband on Sunday that ''obstacles'' to his release included his demand that the South African Government lift the three-year-old national state of emergency.\nBut Thabo Mbeki, the Congress's head of international affairs and one of its most prominent officials, said in an interview that Mr. Mandela's position was that the Government must meet certain demands, including an end to the state of emergency and the release of all political prisoners, in order to create the proper political climate in which to begin negotiations with the Congress and other opponents of apartheid.\nBut Mr. Mandela has not linked his release from prison, where he has spent the last 27 years, to any demands, Mr. Mbeki said.\n''I'm sure Winnie misunderstood him,'' Mr. Mbeki said when told about the press reports. ''It's not true that he doesn't want to come out if the Government doesn't meet demands. His position is that if he can come out today, then he comes out today.''\n'The Creation of a Climate'\n''What Nelson has been saying to the regime,'' he said, ''is that it is necessary to resolve this question by political means, by negotiations, but that in order to get there, the regime must create the climate that all of us are talking about. He is insisting on the issue of the creation of a climate, not that his release is conditional on the creation of that climate.\n''He has not raised that question,'' Mr. Mbeki continued. ''He hasn't said, 'Create this climate and I will only come out or prefer to come out once this climate is created.' He is saying, to begin this process of negotiations, this climate must be created. The question of his own release, well, as far as he is concerned, he should have come out a long time ago.''\nMr. Mbeki and other leaders of the Congress gathered in Stockholm over the weekend to visit the organization's president, Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke at a clinic here, and to exchange ideas about the organizational and political tasks facing the group following the major political changes announced on Friday by the South African President, F. W. de Klerk.\nMr. de Klerk announced the lifting of bans on the Congress, the South African Communist Party and other political opponents, the imminent release of Mr. Mandela and the suspension of executions, all of which were important demands the Congress had made as conditions for opening talks with the Government.\nMr. de Klerk also said he would free political prisoners who had not been convicted of such offenses as murder or terrorism. But he did not entirely rescind the declaration of a state of emergency, saying there was still too much political unrest.\nMoves Toward 'Restructuring'\nMr. Mbeki said that the Congress's national executive committee, its governing body, would consult with anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa and meet within 7 days in Lusaka, Zambia, where the group has its headquarters, to decide how to restructure itself in order to operate in South Africa as a legal organization.\nA prepared statement by Alfred Nzo, the Congress's secretary general, said that ''work has already begun to bring about a disciplined and ordered restructuring of the A.N.C., taking into account the new conditions.''\nMr. Mbeki said that Mr. de Klerk's decision not to free those political prisoners convicted of offenses other than simply belonging to one of the formerly banned parties left unclear the fate of any political exiles who decided to return to South Africa. The release of all political prisoners is a basic demand of the Congress and the issue remains a major obstacle to the opening of negotiations.\n''We are all trained and could be deployed as military people,'' Mr. Mbeki said, adding that the Congress had no plans to dismantle its military wing in the immediate future.\n''In circumstances where de Klerk says that people convicted for terrorism will remain in prison, the deduction must be that if we return we would be charged with terrorism, especially in view of the fact that the regime still has not done what we said should happen, which is the repeal of repressive legislation, such as the Internal Security Act, under which people are charged.''",

        "Title": "PRESIDENT CONCEDES, REAGAN, SWEEPING MIDWEST AND SOUTH, DEFEATS CARTER, Republican Gains Victories in All Areas and Vows to Act on Economy",
        "Content": "Ronald Wilson Reagan, riding a tide of economic discontent against Jimmy Carter and promising \u2018\u2018to put America back to work again,\u201d was elected the nation\u2019s 40th President yesterday with a sweep of surprising victories in the East, South and the crucial battlegrounds of the Middle West.\n\nAt 69 years of age, the former California Governor became the oldest person ever elected to the White House. He built a stunning electoral landslide by taking away Mr. Carter\u2019s Southern base, smashing his expected strength in the East, and taking command of the Middle West, which both sides had designated as the main testing ground. The entire West was his, as expected.\n\nMr. Carter, who labored hard for a comeback re-election victory similar to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948, instead became the first elected incumbent President since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to go down to defeat at the polls.\n\nConcession by Carter\n\nDespite pre-election polls that had forecast a fairly close election, the rout was so pervasive and so quickly apparent that Mr. Carter made the earliest concession statement of a major Presidential candidate since 1904 when Alton B. Parker bowed to Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nAt9:50 P.M., Mr. Carter appeared with his wife, Rosalynn, before supporters at the ballroom of the Sheraton Washington Hotel and disclosed that an hour earlier he had telephoned Mr. Reagan to concede and to pledge cooperation for the transition to new leadership.\n\n\u201cThe people of the United States have made their choice and, of course, I accept that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand here tonight and say it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nAt a celebration in the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, Mr. Reagan claimed his victory and said: \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been a more humbling moment in my life. I give you my sacred oath that I will do my utmost to justify your faith.\"\n\nWith 73 percent of the popular vote counted, Mr. Reagan had 31,404,169 votes, or 50 percent, to 26,295,331, or 42 percent, for Mr. Carter, with John B. Anderson, the independent, drawing 3,862,679, or 6 percent of the national total.\n\nMr. Reagan also suggested that enough Congressional candidates might ride the coattails of his broad sweep to give Republicans a chance to \u201chave control of one house of Congress for the first time in a quarter of a century.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Republicans picked up Senateseats in New Hampshire, Indiana, Washington, Iowa, Alabama, Florida and South Dakota and were leading in Idaho. Going into the election, the Senate had 58Democrats, 41 Republicans and one independent. The Republicans also appeared likely to gain at least 20 seats in theHouse, nowhere nearly enough to dislodge the Democratic majority.\n\nIn the Presidential race, Mr. Carter managed six victories \u2014 in Georgia, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota and the District of Columbia \u2014 for 45 electoral votes. But everywhere else the news was bad for him. By early this morning, Mr. Reagan had won 39 states with 444 electoral votes, and more were leaning his way.\n\nIn the South, the states of Texas, Flor ida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia,South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky fell to the Reagan forces, an almost total rejection of thePresident by his home region. In the Middle West, the former California Governor took Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, three states on which Mr. Carter had pinned heavy hopes, as well as most others.\n\nBut Mr. Reagan\u2019s showing was even more startling in the East. He took New York and Pennsylvania, always vitalbases for Democrats, as well as New Jersey, Connecticut and several smaller States.\n\nA New York Times/CBS News poll of more than 10,000 voters as they left the polls indicated that the predominant motivation among voters was the conviction that it was time for a change. The biggest issue in their minds was the nation\u2019s economy, especially inflation.\n\n\u2018The Iranian thing reminded people of all their frustration,\u2019\u2019 Robert S. Strauss, the Carter campaign chairman said. \u2018They just poured down on him. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything anyone could have done differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really a referendum on leadership,\u201d countered Richard Wirthlin, the Reagan pollster. \u2018\u201c\u2018The Presidential debate did not have a tremendous influence on the vote, but it strengthened Reagan\u2019s credibility for taking Carter on as sharply as we did in the last five days and drive home the attack on the economy.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe Times /CBS News survey revealed a general collapse of the traditional coalition that has elected Democratic Presidents since the New Deal. It showed Mr.Carter running behind his 1976 performance not only in the South but also among such groups as blue-collar workers, Roman Catholics and Jews.\n\nPocketbook Issues Stressed\n\nAlthough the President had tried to make foreign policy, especially nuclear arms control, the principal issue of the election, voters leaving the polls told interviewers that pocketbook issues had been more decisive in their voting. Thirty-five percent of those interviewed said their family financial situation was worse than a year ago, and in that group, Mr. Reagan led the President by 65 to 25 percent.\n\nThat kind of voting pattern was particularly damaging to the President in such crucial battlegrounds as Pennsylvania,Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. The dimensions of his defeat carried a number of other Democratic incumbents down with him, including prominent liberal senators like Birch Bayh of Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota, as well as the House Democratic whip, John Brademas of Indiana.\n\nIn addition to the Presidency, 34 Senate seats, 13 governorships, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and about 7,500 seats in state legislatures were at stake in the election.\n\nG.0.P. Hopes in Senate\n\nRiding Mr. Reagan\u2019s coattails, Republican candidates for Congress seemed likely to exceed their advance expectations of picking up 15 to 20 seats and half a dozen in the Senate.\n\nNationwide, Mr. Reagan\u2019s overall margin was greater than Mr. Anderson\u2019s vote and his sweep So extensive that he largely put to rest the Carter contentions that the Illinois Congressman was \u2018\u2018the spoiler\u201ddepriving the President of winning margins in key states.\n\nMr. Anderson made his concession statement at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Washington, about an hour after thePresident spoke, asserting that his campaign had contributed \u2018\u2018a new realism\u2019\u2019 to American politics. His vote total seemed to guarantee him Federal subsidies to help repay his campaign debts. He needed a minimum of 5 percent of the vote to qualify for Federal funds.\n\nAll the indications were that Mr. Rea gan\u2019s solid year of active campaigning had put to rest voter worries about his age.\n\nAs expected, he was the solid favorite of men, holding close to a 5-to-3 advantage over Mr. Carter in that group, according to the Times / CBS News Poll. Despite earlier indications that the Californian might be penalized among women by his opposition to the equal rights amendment, he managed to run even with the President in that group. That was the only demographic category in which Mr. Carter ran even with his challenger. ,\n\nThe mood of the two men, as they voted, reflected their advance estimates of the balloting. Mr. Carter had been given a pessimistic overnight report by his polyester, Patrick H. Caddell, who cautioned that this year there had not been the kind of election-eve surge that lifted the former Governor of Georgia to victory in 1976.\n\nCarter Pledge in Plains\n\nMr. Carter, his voice breaking and tears welling in his eyes, told well -wishers in his hometown of Plains, Ga., \u2018I will not disappoint you.\u2019\u2019 Some in the small crowd were crying.\n\n\u201cI've tried to honor my commitment,\u201dhe went on, but he had to pause for a moment to regain self-control, \u2018to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u2019 he said in conclusion.\n\nMr. Reagan, who has been jaunty and joking over the last several days as aides reported firm momentum since the Presidential debate on Oct. 28, voted at a neighbor\u2019s house near his home at Pacific Palisades, outside Los Angeles.\n\nWhen reporters asked if he expected to win, Mr. Reagan replied: \u2018\u201cYou know me. I\u2019m too superstitious to answer anything like that.\u201d But his wife, Nancy, nudged\n\nhim and whispered, \u2018\u2018cautiously optimistic,\u201d and he echoed, \u2018\u2018Yes, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe Carter camp had pinned its final hopes on a big voter turnout and a break through in the Iranian hostage crisis, but Mr. Caddell said the Iranian situation had worked against the President in the last 48 hours.\n\nAssessments of Outcome\n\nHis analysis was that after the debate, the President had fallen 5 percentage points behind Mr. Reagan but recovered by last Saturday night. On Sunday, Mr. Caddell said, Mr. Carter was once again down 5 points and 10 points behind byMonday. \u201cIt was all related to the hostages and events overseas,\u201d\u2019 he said.\n\nBut the Republican pollster, Mr. Wirth lin, differed, saying that the President\u2019s credibility had been damaged and Mr.Reagan\u2019s strengthened in the debate, laying the basis for the final Republican attacks on Mr. Carter\u2019s economic record.His own polling showed a mounting Reagan lead since the day after the debate, he said.\n\nMr. Wirthlin also attributed the unexpectedly large Republican margins in state after state to extremely effective organizations that got out a heavy vote and to the collapse of the Democratic Coalition. \u2018\u2018We cracked the unions, blue collar voters, ethnics, Catholics and the South, just as he had planned,\u201d\u2019 he said.\n\nIn the Northeast, Middle Atlantic States and coastal regions of the South, there were showers through much of the day, but most of the country had clear weather, cool in the Northern states and warm and pleasant in the South and Southwest.\n\nVoting officials in major states like New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Florida reported long lines and fairly heavy balloting early in the day. In Columbus, Ohio, polling officials had to add extra voting machines to handle the crowds.\n\nMost experts had been expecting turnout to fall below the 54 percent of the eligible voters who cast ballots in 1976. Census estimates placed the number of eligible voters at 160,491,000 and the likely turnout at not more than 88 million.\nAppeal to Anderson Backers\n\nLow turnout and Mr. Anderson's pull among potential Democratic voters were major worries for Mr. Carter. With a low turnout, Mr. Carter kept warning, \u201cWe Democrats can beat ourselves.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your vote,\u2019\u2019 he pleaded to Anderson supporters in a voice raspy from dawn-till-dusk campaigning in the homestretch drive.\n\nFor the President, the election year has been an unpredictable roller-coaster. A year ago, before the American Embassy was seized in Teheran, he looked as though he was headed toward almost certain defeat and might not even be renominated. But after the American hostages were taken, patriotic support rallied to him, and he overtook his main Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, in the polls and took an unbeatable lead in the primaries.\n\nIn mid-summer he was once again far behind, this time trailing Mr. Reagan in the polls by 20 points. But when Senator Kennedy healed the Democratic rift and began vigorously campaigning for the Carter-Mondale ticket, Democratic voters began \u2018\u2018coming home\u201d and the polls see-sawed until the debate.\n\nWhen surveys showed Mr. Reagangaining from their confrontation in Cleveland, the President stepped up the frantic pace of his campaigning. But there was too much ground for him to cover. He had to divide time between fighting for the battleground states of the industrial belt from New Jersey to Wisconsin and protecting his crumbling southern base in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina.\n\nThe strain began to show in the final week. \u2018I need you,\" Mr. Carter kept telling his rallies trying to energize a vigorous push from blacks, Hispanic-Americans and other traditionally Democratic voting groups. His right hand was red and bruised from endless hand-shaking and his face, puffy and lined from the relentless pace he had set.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Reagan concentrated his efforts on the pivotal states,bolstered by increasingly confident projections from his own pollsters.",

        "Topic": "2010: The Haiti earthquake",
        "Title": "Fierce Quake Devastates Haitian Capital - The New York Times",
        "Content": "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic  A fierce earthquake struck Haiti late Tuesday afternoon, causing a crowded hospital to collapse, leveling countless shantytown dwellings and bringing even more suffering to a nation that was already the hemispheres poorest and most disaster-prone.\nThe earthquake, the worst in the region in more than 200 years, left the country in a shambles. As night fell in Port-au-Prince, Haitis capital, fires burned near the shoreline downtown, but otherwise the city fell into darkness. The electricity was out, telephones were not working and relief workers struggled to make their way through streets blocked by rubble.\nIn the chaos, it was not possible for officials to determine how many people had been killed and injured, but they warned that the casualties could be substantial.\nThe physical toll was easier to assess. The headquarters of the United Nations mission was seriously damaged, the United Nations said in a statement, and many employees were missing. Part of the national palace had collapsed, The Associated Press reported.\nA hospital collapsed in Ptionville, a hillside district in Port-au-Prince that is home to many diplomats and wealthy Haitians, a videographer for The Associated Press said. And an American government official reported seeing houses that had tumbled into a ravine.\nTequila Minsky, a photographer based in New York who was in Port-au-Prince, said that a wall at the front of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen, killing a passer-by. A number of nearby buildings had crumbled, trapping people, she said, and a Unibank bank building was badly damaged. People were screaming.\nIt was general mayhem, Ms. Minsky said.\nThe earthquake, with a magnitude estimated at 7.0, struck just before 5 p.m. about 10 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the United States Geological Survey said. Many aftershocks followed and more were expected, said David Wald, a Geological Survey seismologist.\nThe main issue here will probably be shaking, he said, and this is an area that is particularly vulnerable in terms of construction practice, and with a high population density. There could be a high number of casualties.\nOxfam, an antipoverty group, said that Kristie van de Wetering, a former employee based in Port-au-Prince, had described houses in rubble everywhere.\nThere is a blanket of dust rising from the valley south of the capital, agency officials said Ms. van de Wetering had told them. We can hear people calling for help from every corner. The aftershocks are ongoing and making people very nervous.\nThe earthquake could be felt across the border in the Dominican Republic, on the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola. High-rise buildings in the capital, Santo Domingo, shook and sent people streaming down stairways into the streets, fearing that the tremor could intensify.\nHaiti sits on a large fault that has caused catastrophic quakes in the past, but this one was described as among the most powerful to hit the region. With many poor residents living in tin-roof shacks that sit precariously on steep ravines and with much of the construction in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in the country of questionable quality, the expectation was that the quake caused major damage to buildings and significant loss of life.\nEverybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken, Henry Bahn, an official of the United States Department of Agriculture who was visiting Haiti, told The Associated Press. The sky is just gray with dust.\nHaitis many man-made woes  its dire poverty, political infighting and proclivity for insurrection  have been exacerbated repeatedly by natural disasters. At the end of 2008, four hurricanes flooded whole towns, knocked out bridges and left a destitute population in even more desperate conditions.\nThe United States and other countries have devoted significant humanitarian support to Haiti, financing a large United Nations peacekeeping mission that has recently reported major gains in controlling crime. International aid has also supported an array of organizations aimed at raising the countrys dismal health and education levels.\nEmergency meetings were being held in Washington, and President Obama issued a statement saying that administration officials were closely monitoring the situation.\nWe stand ready to assist the people of Haiti, Mr. Obama said.\nThe Caribbean is not usually considered a seismic danger zone, but earthquakes have struck here in the past.\nTheres a history of large, devastating earthquakes, said Paul Mann, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas, but theyre separated by hundreds of years.\nMost of Haiti lies on the Gonave microplate, a sliver of the earths crust between the much larger North American plate to the north and the Caribbean plate to the south. The earthquake on Tuesday occurred when what appears to be part of the southern fault zone broke and slid.\nThe fault is similar in structure to the San Andreas fault that slices through California, Dr. Mann said.\nSuch earthquakes, which are called strike-slip, tend to be shallow and produce violent shaking at the surface.\nThey can be very devastating, especially when there are cities nearby, Dr. Mann said.\nVictor Tsai, a seismologist at the National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey, said the depth of Tuesdays earthquake was only about six miles and the quake was a 9 on a 1-to-10 scale that measures ground shaking. We expect substantial damage from this event, he said.\nIn the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami, customers began streaming into the Louis Market shortly after news of the earthquake hit the airwaves. They were buying $5 phone cards in a desperate attempt to reach relatives in Haiti.\nEveryone who walks in here is crazy, worried, depressed, said Myrlande Cherenfant, 20.\nAt the Notre Dame de Haiti Roman Catholic church, a handful of parishioners in red-cushioned seats pressed redial on their phones over and over. Some said that they had been able to get through immediately after the earthquake.\nI was able to talk to a priest in Haiti, the Rev. Reginald Jean-Mary said. The only word I heard was catastrophe and then it cut off.\nHe said that in a later call he was told that the cathedral in Port-au-Prince had been destroyed and that other churches had been damaged.\nJean-Robert Lafortune, executive director of the Miami-based Haitian American Grassroots Coalition, said that Haiti had endured a cycle of natural disasters and man-made disasters, and this is one more big catastrophe.\nWe are in trauma, he said. We have loved ones there and many of them will be victims. Were calling and calling, but theres nothing on the other end.",

        "Topic": "1996: Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, is born",
        "Title": "SCIENTIST REPORTS FIRST CLONING EVER OF ADULT MAMMAL - The New York Times",
        "Content": "In a feat that may be the one bit of genetic engineering that has been anticipated and dreaded more than any other, researchers in Britain are reporting that they have cloned an adult mammal for the first time.\nThe group, led by Dr. Ian Wilmut, a 52-year-old embryologist at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, created a lamb using DNA from an adult sheep. The achievement shocked leading researchers who had said it could not be done. The researchers had assumed that the DNA of adult cells would not act like the DNA formed when a sperm's genes first mingle with those of an egg.\nIn theory, researchers said, such techniques could be used to take a cell from an adult human and use the DNA to create a genetically identical human -- a time-delayed twin. That prospect raises the thorniest of ethical and philosophical questions.\nDr. Wilmut's experiment was simple, in retrospect. He took a mammary cell from an adult sheep and prepared its DNA so it would be accepted by an egg from another sheep. He then removed the egg's own DNA, replacing it with the DNA from the adult sheep by fusing the egg with the adult cell. The fused cells, carrying the adult DNA, began to grow and divide, just like a perfectly normal fertilized egg, to form an embryo.\nDr. Wilmut implanted the embryo into another ewe; in July, the ewe gave birth to a lamb, named Dolly. Though Dolly seems perfectly normal, DNA tests show that she is the clone of the adult ewe that supplied her DNA.\n''What this will mostly be used for is to produce more health care products,'' Dr. Wilmut told the Press Association of Britain early today, the Reuters news agency reported.\n''It will enable us to study genetic diseases for which there is presently no cure and track down the mechanisms that are involved. The next step is to use the cells in culture in the lab and target genetic changes into that culture.''\nSimple though it may be, the experiment, to be reported this coming Thursday in the British journal Nature, has startled biologists and ethicists. Dr. Wilmut said in a telephone interview last week that he planned to breed Dolly next fall to determine whether she was fertile. Dr. Wilmut said he was interested in the technique primarily as a tool in animal husbandry, but other scientists said it had opened doors to the unsettling prospect that humans could be cloned as well.\nDr. Lee Silver, a biology professor at Princeton University, said last week that the announcement had come just in time for him to revise his forthcoming book so the first chapter will no longer state that such cloning is impossible.\n''It's unbelievable,'' Dr. Silver said. ''It basically means that there are no limits. It means all of science fiction is true. They said it could never be done and now here it is, done before the year 2000.''\nDr. Neal First, a professor of reproductive biology and animal biotechnology at the University of Wisconsin, who has been trying to clone cattle, said the ability to clone dairy cattle could have a bigger impact on the industry than the introduction of artificial insemination in the 1950's, a procedure that revolutionized dairy farming. Cloning could be used to make multiple copies of animals that are especially good at producing meat or milk or wool.\nAlthough researchers have created genetically identical animals by dividing embryos very early in their development, Dr. Silver said, no one had cloned an animal from an adult until now. Earlier experiments, with frogs, have become a stock story in high school biology, but the experiments never produced cloned adult frogs. The frogs developed only to the tadpole stage before dying.\nIt was even worse with mammals. Researchers could swap DNA from one fertilized egg to another, but they could go no further. ''They couldn't even put nuclei from late-stage mouse embryos into early mouse embryos,'' Dr. Silver said. The embryos failed to develop and died.\nAs a result, the researchers concluded that as cells developed, the proteins coating the DNA somehow masked all the important genes for embryo development. A skin cell may have all the genetic information that was present in the fertilized egg that produced the organism, for example, but almost all that information is pasted over. Now all the skin cell can do is be a skin cell.\nResearchers could not even hope to strip off the proteins from an adult cell's DNA and replace them with proteins from an embryo's DNA. The DNA would shatter if anyone tried to strip it bare, Dr. Silver said.\nLast year, Dr. Wilmut showed that he could clone DNA from sheep embryo cells, but even that was not taken as proof that the animal itself could be cloned. It could just be that the embryo cells had DNA that was unusually conducive to cloning, many thought.\nDr. Wilmut, however, hit on a clever strategy. He did not bother with the proteins that coat DNA, and instead focused on getting the DNA from an adult cell into a stage in its normal cycle of replication where it could take up residence in an egg.\nDNA in growing cells goes through what is known as the cell cycle: it prepares itself to divide, then replicates itself and splits in two as the cell itself divides. The problem with earlier cloning attempts, Dr. Wilmut said, was that the DNA from the donor had been out of synchrony with that of the recipient cell. The solution, he discovered, was, in effect, to put the DNA from the adult cell to sleep, making it quiescent by depriving the adult cell of nutrients. When he then fused it with an egg cell from another sheep -- after removing the egg cell's DNA -- the donor DNA took over as though it belonged there.\nDr. Wilmut said in the telephone interview last week that the method could work for any animal and that he hoped to use it next to clone cattle. He said that he could use many types of cells from adults for cloning but that the easiest to use would be so-called stem cells, which give rise to a variety of other cells and are present throughout the body.\nIn his sheep experiment, he used mammary cells because a company that sponsored his work, PPL Therapeutics, is developing sheep that can be used to produce proteins that can be used as drugs in their milk, so it had sheep mammary cells readily available.\nFor Dr. Wilmut, the main interest of the experiment is to advance animal research. PPL, for example, wants to clone animals that can produce pharmacologically useful proteins, like the clotting factor needed by hemophiliacs. Scientists would grow cells in the laboratory, insert the genes for production of the desired protein, select those cells that most actively churned out the protein and use those cells to make cloned females. The cloned animals would produce immense amounts of the proteins in their milk, making the animals into living drug factories.\nBut that is only the beginning, Dr. Wilmut said. Researchers could use the same method to make animals with human diseases, like cystic fibrosis, and then test therapies on the cloned animals. Or they could use cloning to alter the proteins on the surfaces of pig organs, like the liver or heart, making the organs more like human organs. Then they could transplant those organs into humans.\nDr. First said the ''exciting and astounding'' cloning result could shake the dairy industry. It could allow the cloning of cows that are superproducers of milk, making 30,000 or even 40,000 pounds of milk a year. The average cow makes about 13,000 pounds of milk a year, he said.\n''I think that if -- and it's a very big if -- cloning were highly efficient,'' Dr. First said last week, ''then it could be a more significant revolution to the livestock industry than even artificial insemination.'' .\nAlthough Dr. Wilmut said he saw no intrinsic biological reason humans, too, could not be cloned, he dismissed the idea as being ethically unacceptable. Moreover, he said, it is illegal in Britain to clone people. ''I would find it offensive'' to clone a human being, Dr. Wilmut said, adding that he fervently hoped that no one would try it.\nBut others said that it was hard to imagine enforcing a ban on cloning people when cloning got more efficient. ''I could see it going on surreptitiously,'' said Lori Andrews, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of law who specializes in reproductive issues. For example, Professor Andrews said last week, in the early days of in vitro fertilization, Australia banned that practice. ''So scientists moved to Singapore'' and offered the procedure, she said. ''I can imagine new crimes,'' she added.\nPeople might be cloned without their knowledge or consent. After all, all that would be needed would be some cells. If there is a market for a sperm bank selling semen from Nobel laureates, how much better would it be to bear a child that would actually be a clone of a great thinker or, perhaps, a great beauty or great athlete?\n''The genie is out of the bottle,'' said Dr. Ronald Munson, a medical ethicist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. ''This technology is not, in principle, policeable.''\nDr. Munson called the possibilities incredible. For example, could researchers devise ways to add just the DNA of an adult cell, without fusing two living cells? If so, might it be possible to clone the dead?\n''I had an idea for a story once,'' Dr. Munson said, in which a scientist obtains a spot of blood from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. He then uses it to clone a man who is Jesus Christ -- or perhaps cannot be.\nOn a more practical note, Dr. Munson mused over the strange twist that science has taken.\n''There's something ironic'' about study, he said. ''Here we have this incredible technical accomplishment, and what motivated it? The desire for more sheep milk of a certain type.'' It is, he said, ''the theater of the absurd acted out by scientists.''\nIn his interview with the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, Dr. Wilmut added early today: ''We are aware that there is potential for misuse, and we have provided information to ethicists and the Human Embryology Authority. We believe that it is important that society decides how we want to use this technology and makes sure it prohibits what it wants to prohibit. It would be desperately sad if people started using this sort of technology with people.''",

        "Topic": "1996: The Taliban takes control of Kabul, Afghanistan",
        "Title": "State Dept. Becomes Cooler To the New Rulers of Kabul - The New York Times",
        "Content": "After a brief flirtation with the Muslim movement known as the Taliban as the apparent victor of the civil war in Afghanistan, the Clinton Administration has decided to keep the Taliban at arms' length.\nThe decision reflects the fluid military situation in Afghanistan and the Administration's desire to distance itself -- particularly during the Presidential campaign -- from a movement that has barred women from working and girls from going to school and has control of vast areas where the opium poppy is grown.\n''We're not going around embracing one group or another willy-nilly,'' said a senior Administration official involved in the Afghan policy. ''That's not only politically correct, that's policy correct.''\nJust a few weeks ago, after the Taliban conquered the capital, Kabul, the State Department was touting the Taliban as the group that might finally bring stability to Afghanistan.\nOn Sept. 27, Glyn Davies, a State Department spokesman, expressed hope that ''the new authorities in Kabul will move quickly to restore order and security and to form a representative interim government that can begin the process of reconciliation nationwide.''\nWhile Mr. Davies called the execution of former President Najibullah ''regrettable,'' he said the United States wanted to send diplomats to Afghanistan to meet with the Taliban and held out the possibility of re-establishing full diplomatic ties with the country. His remarks fed speculation in the region that the United States had aided the Taliban, despite the Administration's repeated denials and the lack of evidence.\nStill, the Taliban have been anti-Iranian, while some of the other factions in Afghanistan have had good relations with Iran. Taliban officials suggested that they would curb the terrorist training camps inside their country.\nBut after largely ignoring events in Afghanistan, senior officials in the White House and the State Department suddenly began to focus on the Taliban and the atmosphere of terror that their rule has spawned in other areas in Afghanistan. They quickly backed away from talk of an embrace.\nIn addition to the movement's harsh interpretation of Islamic law that represses women and imposes severe punishments including the execution of drug traffickers, the Taliban has had control for more than a year over the Helmand Valley, where vast amounts of opium poppy are grown.\nOne of their military commanders held Chinese and Pakistanis hostage for 13 months until July 1994, depriving them at times of food and giving them no medical help. And the United States intervened last summer to help persuade the Taliban to free Russian pilots they were holding hostage.\n''To the extent there was a sense that a Taliban victory might be positive, it was focused on ending the anarchy and controlling terrorist camps and drugs,'' a senior State Department official said. ''But then we began to have serious questions about the benefits that would come from Taliban control.''\nThree days after Mr. Davies's remarks, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, refined the message. He condemned Mr. Najibullah's execution, called the Taliban's situation on the ground ''quite murky,'' said there was no thought of upgrading diplomatic ties and expressed concern about the Taliban's human rights record.\nJust before John Holtzman, the charge d'affaires in the United States Embassy in Pakistan, was to arrive in Afghanistan to meet with Taliban leaders on Oct. 3, Washington canceled his trip, in part because the Taliban themselves did not want to receive him. Instead, a Taliban delegation called on him in Islamabad.\n''The last thing we wanted to do was fuel this total misperception that we were recognizing and embracing the Taliban,'' a senior State Department official said.\nIn the last week, forces loyal to Afghanistan's ousted coalition Government have launched a counteroffensive to retake the capital, making it unlikely that the Taliban can consolidate their military gains or establish the nationwide peace that some had imagined.\nThe lack of attention to Afghanistan at senior levels may have contributed to the Administration's uneven reaction to events there.\nOn Sept. 18, for example, Lee Coldren, the head of the State Department's office concerned with Afghanistan, drafted a memo warning that contrary to the prevailing view, the Taliban forces might well take over Kabul.\nThe memo never made its way up to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. And nine days later, when the Taliban marched into the Afghan capital, stunned American policy makers began scrambling to figure out how to react.\nThe shifting of the Administration's position coincided with a similar shift by the Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, which is working with Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil Company to build a gas pipeline and an oil pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban's control.\nSoon after the Taliban's capture of Kabul, Chris Taggart, executive vice president of Unocal International Energy Ventures, was quoted by Reuters as calling it ''very positive.'' He said the projects were now more likely to succeed, adding, ''If the Taliban leads to stability and international recognition, then it's positive.''\nBut Administration officials and private consultants to Unocal told the company that its optimism was premature. Company officials said Mr. Taggart was misquoted; they have since toned down their statements.\n''We are fanatically neutral when it comes to politics,'' said Marty Miller, the Unocal vice president in charge of the project. ''What we need is a government that has broad support of all the people of Afghanistan and that has international recognition. Until we have that in place, it will be difficult to do the pipeline.''\nThe Clinton Administration has pushed the project, and President Clinton himself last year personally urged President Saparmurat A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan to sign a contract for it, a senior Administration official said.\nBut a senior Administration official said promotion of the pipeline plan was not an important factor in the Administration's recent thinking on whether to support the Taliban.",

        "Topic": "1989: The United States invasion of Panama",
        "Title": "U.S. Invasion Is Debated in Panama - The New York Times",
        "Content": "One of the happiest days in Martha D.'s life came last year when Washington began seeking the overthrow of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega; one of the unhappiest, the day she realized the United States would not invade.\n''I felt exactly the same way as the day I was told Santa Claus doesn't exist,'' said Mrs. D., a figure in Panamanian political and social life who spoke on the condition that she would not be fully identified. ''Don't get me wrong, my admiration for the U.S. is extraordinary, even if I don't think it's Santa Claus anymore.''\nNow invasion fever is growing once again. The arrival Friday of the first of almost 2,000 reinforcements dispatched by President Bush has led many Panamanians to express hope that the United States will solve Panama's problem for Panamanians by sending in the marines to drive out the general, the country's 53-year-old de facto ruler.\n''The majority of the people will clap and wave the troops on,'' said a former aide to Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who built a legendary political career here out of populist anti-American campaigns. ''They'll give them water, coffee and sandwiches.'' Services Have Deteriorated\nWhile pro-invasion sentiment is widespread, it is far from unanimous. It is in large part little more than general dissatisfaction with the regime's inability to deliver services, which have deteriorated steadily throughout the 18-month crisis.\n''If you have a cancer, you have to cut it out,'' said one Panamanian. ''The whole country wants to be liberated from Noriega. We don't want an invasion, but it's our only hope to get rid of this evil.''\nBut many Panamanians say an invasion would quickly provoke a backlash. They note that nationalist fever was fanned by Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera's demand for sovereignty over the Panama Canal after he took power in a coup in 1968. Demonstrations at Balboa High School to protest the equal treatment given Panamanian and American flags erupted into riots in 1964 in which at least two dozen Panamanians and six Americans were killed. But the canal treaties signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and General Torrijos, who died in a helicopter crash in 1981, went a long way toward calming matters.\nToday, the leaders of the political opposition who apparently won the May 7 election remain united, publicly at least, against any invasion or direct American military intervention. In large part, that stems from the regime's attacks on them as ''Yankee stooges'' who have ''sold out'' the country.\nBut it also stems from geopolitical reasons. An invasion would almost certainly isolate any subsequent government from most other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Even the threat of an invasion has rubbed Latin Americans' anti-American nerve. Their denunciations of the Noriega regime, widespread electoral fraud and brutal crackdowns have been coupled almost without exception with strong warnings against ''foreign intervention.''\nStill, for many Panamanians the removal of General Noriega by American troops would be a welcome event, despite a yearlong anti-American campaign by the Government. 'Bring Them In'\nRicardo Melendez Vasquez, a 29-year-old unemployed carpenter, said: ''In my neighborhood, everybody is for an invasion. Now.'' Mr. Melendez, who has had to put off his wedding plans because of the depression ravaging what was once the region's financial jewel, added, ''Bring them in.'\nSuch sentiments, rare in Latin America, spring from this country's traditionally close ties to the United States. Panama was not a country until 1903 when Theodore Roosevelt paved the way for the building of the canal by arranging for what was then a province of Colombia to secede.\nOver the years, this city became Miami south, a metropolis with shimmering skyscrapers and worldwide touch-tone telephone service. With its wide avenues and tropical shade trees, it had more in common with a typical Florida suburb than other Latin American cities.\nFor decades the United States has based tens of thousands of troops here. Many Panamanians say they think an invasion would be little more than a carnival in which thousands of free-spending soldiers would infuse dollars into the withering economy.\n''There'll be about four people who fight,'' said one Panamanian, who supports an invasion even though he has long ties to Arnulfo Arias. ''It'll be a fiesta.''\nBut the vitriolic anti-American campaign has struck a sympathetic chord in many Panamanians, especially among the poor and blacks. Many note that Americans imposed strict segregation while running the canal and minorities suffered disproportionate casualties while constructing the 50-mile-long waterway. ''It was nothing less than slavery,'' recalled a retired black union leader whose father died while building the canal.\nAnti-Americanism is considered particularly strong among the 15,000-man United States-trained armed forces. It is also the bedrock of the Dignity Battalions, paramilitary troops started last year as part of the regime's effort to fan the nationalistic flame. Benjamin Colamarco, the commander, said that weapons had been distributed to the 10,000 men in the paramilitary squads and that they would ''fight to the last man.''",

        "Topic": "2002: The Euro currency is introduced in physical form",
        "Title": "Euro Edges Past The Dollar In a Victory For Europeans - The New York Times",
        "Content": "The euro became worth slightly more than the battered American dollar today for the first time in more than two years, giving Europeans a shot of pride at a time when many of them view the United States with some resentment.\nIn a period when the United States is the world's only superpower, often perceived as selfish and unthinking about its European allies, today's little psychological victory of the euro over the dollar provided some not-so-sheepish satisfaction.\nAnalysts cautioned that the surge of the euro was largely about the weakness of the dollar, which they hoped would not fall too far too fast, dragging down the world economy. The dollar also fell to a near 10-month low against the Japanese yen and multiyear lows against the British pound and the Swiss franc. The euro finished United States trading at $1.0055.\n''Mentally and psychologically, it is important, yes,'' said Josef Janning, head of the politics division of the Bertelsmann Foundation.\nCurrencies go up and down, but they provide a rough judgment of the confidence of investors in national economies and markets. And even if this renewed equality is less about a strong euro than worries on Wall Street translating into a troubled dollar, ''the effect is the same in the way Europeans feel vis--vis the United States,'' Mr. Janning said.\nWhen the euro was weak -- as it has been for most of its three and a half years -- there was ''a sense of decline felt in the society, especially in countries with a hard-currency background, like the old Deutsch mark zone,'' Mr. Janning said.\nA stronger euro helps bolster the European economy by making it easier for the European central bank to control inflation without having to raise interest rates. But the weakening of the dollar is not all bad for the United States; in particular it benefits American manufacturers by allowing them to sell goods abroad more cheaply and enables them to compete more effectively against foreign rivals.\nSome analysts said that Americans may now begin to take the euro seriously as a symbol of how far Europe's efforts at integration have come. ''This is not the worst thing for the trans-Atlantic relationship,'' a senior German diplomat said.\nThe European Union, 15 countries working to expand to 25 by 2004, is already a rival to the United States in the size of its population and of its economy. And it is debating a new constitution to make it more efficient and perhaps more united.\nBut as a collection of nation-states that have different views about how much power to cede to Brussels, the union has viewed the euro -- like the common European passport -- as an important symbol of the reality of this experiment in shared sovereignty. And that makes the moment of its breakthrough especially significant to Europeans.\nThe euro began life as a virtual currency on Jan. 4, 1999, worth about $1.18. As a measure of its member economies, whose currencies were then fixed at a certain rate against the euro, it created a more stable money based on a wider economic area. The idea was ''to insulate the European economy from the volatility in the currency markets that had been devastating individual countries for 30 years,'' said Fabio Scacciavillani, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs in London.\nBut the euro immediately slid against the dollar, hitting a record low of 82.25 cents in October 2000, just after the Danes rejected joining the euro zone. The euro, as a physical currency with its own bills and coins, went into circulation in 12 of the 15 member states of the European Union on Jan. 1 of this year.\n''Certainly, parity is a psychological boost that could have important repercussions that are more tangible,'' Mr. Scacciavillani said. ''It's about confidence, and it could impact the availability of capital and lower long-term interest rates if people buy euro financial instruments.''\nBut the fundamentals of the economies on either side of the Atlantic do not make a clear case for the long-term prospects of the euro against the dollar, he and others said.\nMr. Scacciavillani said that the weakness of the dollar was driven by concerns over the gaping trade deficit in the United States ''and the need to finance this deficit at a time when stock markets are weak and not attracting much capital from abroad.''\nOscar-Erich Kuntze, an international economist at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said, ''What we've not had until recently is twin deficits in the United States,'' both a trade deficit and a budget deficit.\nHe said the deficits combined with the business scandals like Enron and Worldcom undermined ''the credibility of the U.S. economy.''\nThat undermined credibility causes foreigners to pull money out of the United States and keep it in short-term investments denominated in euros, a senior German government economist said. ''It's not really being invested right now,'' he said.\nThe idea of parity is a form of magic, of no significance in strictly economic terms, Mr. Kuntze said. ''But weakness in the euro does have a detrimental psychological effect on the Europeans,'' who are feeling a bit more optimistic, he said.\n''As a German I know how important psychology is in politics and economics,'' he said. ''The strong German mark had such a strong effect on our psychology and this case may be similar.''\nWith Germany in the middle of an election campaign centering on a weak economy and high unemployment, every little bit of good news can help the incumbent chancellor, Gerhard Schrder, who faces a strong challenge from the conservative Edmund Stoiber.\nStill, Christoph Bertram, a well-known analyst, said the psychological impact would not be very deep. ''For a while people thought that a strong currency is a virility symbol, but those days are gone,'' he said. ''This won't lead to fireworks on Potsdamer Platz,'' the rebuilt center of a reunified Berlin.\nAt the same time, no one wants to see a collapse of the dollar and a large flight of capital from the United States. ''If this happens in a bigger way,'' a senior German official said, ''there will be a lot of fright.''\nCharles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform in London, said a stronger euro would provide help to those who want Britain to replace the pound with the euro. ''It will put a bit of spring into the stride of the bedraggled pro-Europeans in this country,'' he said.\nHe said the euro's value was only one issue in a highly political decision for the Labor government. More broadly, he said, ''if parity gets people in the United States to understand that the euro is there and won't go away, then it's good.''",

        "Title": "Differences emerge in Europe of a response to Georgia conflict - The New York Times",
        "Content": "PARIS  If the United States and Europe have sounded different notes over the conflict between Russia and Georgia, an equally striking split has emerged between some leaders in Western and Eastern Europe over the causes and consequences of the violence.\nPresident Lech Kaczynski of Poland and his counterparts from Ukraine and the three Baltic countries traveled to Tbilisi on Tuesday to express their solidarity with Georgia, a country that, like their own nations, spent decades in the grip of the Soviet Union.\n\"Russia has again shown its true face,\" Kaczynski said Tuesday, questioning whether the Russian decision to halt military activity in Georgia was permanent.\nThe trip by Kaczynski, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves of Estonia, President Valdis Zatlers of Latvia, President Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania and President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine comes three days after their countries issued a joint statement urging the European Union and NATO to \"stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy\" by Russia.\nIn Moscow, they warned, refusal to give Georgia fast-track access to NATO membership \"was seen as a green light for aggression.\"\nAll five countries have memories of what they now view as occupation by Russia. The Baltic countries and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union; Poland has a long history of conflict with Russia.\nThese views from Eastern Europe stand in stark contrast to the calibrated statements from French and German officials, which have refrained from designating a culprit in the conflict. On the other end of the spectrum, Italian officials appeared to side with Russia.\n\"We cannot create an anti-Russia coalition in Europe, and on this point we are close to Putin's position,\" the Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, told La Stampa in an interview published Monday, stressing that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was a close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia. Frattini is also European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security.\n\"This war has pushed Georgia further away\" from Europe, Frattini said.\nFrance, which holds the EU presidency, and Germany, which has close links to both Russia and Georgia, have taken the lead in the diplomatic effort.\nIn Brussels on Wednesday, further European divisions may emerge when the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, briefs his 26 EU counterparts on his mediation efforts in Russia and Georgia. Not all East Europeans back Georgia; not all Western Europeans are as equivocal as the public statements designed to defuse the conflict.\nOne question that will almost certainly continue to divide Europe is the Georgian bid to join NATO, which will be on the table again at an alliance meeting in December.\nAt a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest in April, France and Germany blocked a U.S.-backed push to give Georgia and Ukraine a so-called membership action plan. Both Paris and Berlin insisted then that this would not jeopardize NATO membership in the future.\nGeorgian officials, backed by some Eastern countries, say that the recent violence should lead to an acceleration of the process to deter Russia from future military action. But French and German diplomats privately said that if anything, the conflict had dimmed Georgian chances of joining NATO in the near future because the strategic environment in the region more fragile.\nThe unease surfaced at a news conference after NATO ambassadors met the Georgian envoy to NATO in Brussels on Tuesday.\nJaap de Hoop Scheffer, secretary general of the alliance, made it clear that \"NATO is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict.\" It will consider unspecified requests from Georgia, and considers Moscow's use of force disproportionate, he said.\nBut membership for Georgia seemed distant. \"The allies have said in Bucharest that one day Georgia will join NATO,\" de Hoop Scheffer said.",

        "Title": "In Copenhagen, To Be Elaborated Signals a Stalemate - The New York Times",
        "Content": "COPENHAGEN  In a symbolic S O S, a United Nations functionary carried an orange-and-white life preserver to a news conference on Tuesday. \n The gesture seemed lighthearted, but the message was not: Progress has been halting in international climate negotiations here. \nYvo de Boer, the top United Nations climate official here, and Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairwoman of the talks, ticked off the daunting issues facing small working groups in the final days of the two-week conference.\nLike windblown leaves, copies of a draft text sprinkled with the phrase to be elaborated flew around the halls of the conference center, testifying to the stalemate on some crucial issues.\nMr. de Boer said the disputes reflected the challenge of finding common ground among 193 countries large and small, rich and poor, vulnerable and resilient, on layered issues that include cutting emissions and paying to deliver more energy choices to nations that have hardly any.\n There are 400 million people in India who lack access to electricity, he said. How do you switch off the light bulb that you dont have?\nThe Animals Rise Up\nSome came dressed like pigs and dairy cows. Others carried giant papier-mch fruits and vegetables on sticks.\n Agriculture was the theme of the event, a noon protest that drew 300 to 400 people to Islands Brygge, a neighborhood on the south side of the inner canal here. Organized under the slogan Resistance Is Ripe, they contended that agricultural issues were being overlooked or mishandled by the government delegates gathered at the Bella Center.\nSurrounded by dozens of police officers in vans, on horseback and on foot, the motley assemblage of cows, pigs, clowns, foods and a brown elephant on wheels  its exact meaning was never quite made clear  sallied through the streets as protesters gave speeches by loudspeaker, played reggae music and banged on drums.\nMessages extolling the virtues of organic and small farms and the benefits to the climate of a vegan diet were abundant.\nFree the 21st-century slaves! read a banner depicting a cow. Reclaim the Fields! said another. \nThings ended peacefully in a driving wet snow outside the Danish Agricultural Association, where the crowd had dwindled to a few dozen.\nNuclear Pros and Cons\nIn a restaurant in an 18th-century warehouse on the waterfront, power brokers from the nuclear industry made their case that the atom would play a big role in a cleaner-energy world.\nThe reception was a counterpoint to weekend exhortations by the anti-nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott, who urged marchers outside the Bella Center to reject nuclear power as a wicked technology spewing waste and plutonium.\nLaurent Corbier, vice president for sustainable development for Areva, the French electricity provider, triumphantly noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change listed nuclear power as a suitable \"mitigation technology in its 2007 report.\nBut he warned that some countries were trying to exclude nuclear plants along with large dams from lists of projects that countries could get credit for as steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions under a proposed global treaty. Nuclear must be part of the solution, he declared.\nThomas M. Kerr, a senior energy analyst from the International Energy Agency in Paris, said that nuclear plants would have to play some role in meeting the energy needs of a growing human population while fossil-fuel emissions were reduced.\nBut nuclear plants alone will not meet the challenge, he said. So after snatching one more hors doeuvre, he headed for the door to hail a cab and go to a dinner with the solar industry. \nIn This Room, Star Power\nOne of the hardest rooms to get into in Copenhagen is the one where mayors from across the globe have gathered to boast about their green credentials.\nThey are part of a group called Local Governments for Sustainability, which has been holding standing-room-only presentations since the opening of the climate conference last week.\nThe organization has 1,100 delegates here, the largest number of any entity except Denmark, the host country.\n Their numbers reflect the mushrooming effort by urban areas, where half the worlds population lives, to drive the conversation on tackling climate change and, perhaps more important, to secure financing for causes like mass transit.\nYet the mayors thunder was stolen to some degree on Tuesday by a governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.\nMr. Schwarzenegger made a pitch for the role of subnational governments like his, which is in the vanguard among American states on environmental issues.\nBut first he had to declare how fantastic it was to be in a foreign country where so many people speak with a non-American accent, just like him.\n I have been here for movie promotions and weight lifting and body building, he mused. I never thought I would get here as the governor of the great state of California and talking about climate change.",

        "Topic": "1993: The establishment of the European Single Market",
        "Title": "Single Euromarket For Schools Faces The Mobility Test - The New York Times",
        "Content": "The European Single Market, which came into force last month, theoretically makes it easier for college students to attend universities in European Community countries other than their own.\nIt also permits teachers to compete for jobs anywhere in the community.\nUnder single market rules, universities have to admit applicants from other countries on the same basis as national students. This means that any student can, in theory, enroll at any institution anywhere in the EC provided he or she meets entrance requirements.\nBut practical difficulties, and especially the lack of language skills, means that the process still is daunting for most students.\nOne fear is that greater mobility will favor the better endowed universities of northern Europe, which will be able to cream off the best students from throughout the community, against those in poorer countries.\nAnother is that students who fail to get into universities in one country will take advantage of the new regulations to seek admission in another country, thus placing higher demands on some systems than others.\nBut as far as the EC Commission is concerned, the more students who study abroad the better. It sees them as the future leaders of a more closely united Europe.\nThe commission encourages the learning of languages, the mobility of students and teachers, the mutual recognition of qualifications and an extension of distance teaching. Jacques Delors, the commission president, has said he wants to make it possible for every student to do at least part of his or her studies in another country.\nTHE commission's budget to do all these things is relatively small, and in the present economic climate many of its hopes remain pious.\nThe Maastricht Treaty on European Union, which still awaits ratification by some countries, places education under the direct competence of the community. The individual states remain responsible for the content and organization of studies, however, and this is unlikely to change.\nBoth at the university and the primary and secondary levels, educational philosophies and methods vary widely from country to country, and even within countries.\nIn the northern nations there is generally more emphasis on decentralization. In Germany, each Land is responsible for education within its borders, and about the only thing organized nationally is the date for school vacations.\nFrance still runs its education system heavily from Paris, although it has started to experiment with decentralization.\nEngland and Wales, which have a tradition of decentralization, are moving in the opposite direction. The government is attempting to impose central control by allowing schools to \"opt out\" of the power of local governments and receive financing directly from the state. So far, only about 300 schools out of more than 30,000 have done so, but the trend is accelerating. London also has imposed a national curriculum of core subjects, with emphasis on sciences, technology and modern languages, and now demands regular testing of pupils at the ages of 7, 11, 14 and 16.\nIn the northern countries, education usually is seen as the responsibility of the state. Student grants - although meager - often are available, which makes it easier for students to attend establishments away from home. The Mediterranean countries see education as the responsibility of the family, which means students are likely to live at home and attend the closest establishment.\nBRITAIN, Germany and the Netherlands have summer vacations of about six weeks, but longer vacations at Christmas and Easter. France has the longest school vacations, about 21/2 months, but makes up for it by piling on work in term-time. At the primary level it crams a record 972 hours of instruction into 180 days, compared with fewer than 600 hours in 200 days in Britain. The sight of small French schoolchildren bowed down with books is familiar.\nSchools in the northern countries are more likely to offer a range of courses beyond the standard curriculum, such as music and art. Mediterranean countries tend to regard such courses as luxuries and expect parents to arrange them privately.\nThere is still a tendency in most countries to send boys toward science and technology courses, and girls to arts courses. In France, for example, young women make up two-thirds of the literature students at university level, but only one-fifth of the science students.\nThe EC Commission has three programs for intercommunity education: Erasmus, for the exchange of university students - more than 59,000 students took advantage of it in 1991; Comett for technology exchanges, involving industries; and Lingua for the exchange of language teachers.\nErasmus last year enabled almost 5 percent of European students to study abroad - 10 times as many as there were five years ago, but still far short of the 10 percent envisaged by the program. At the secondary level, there is a growing tendency for schools to arrange individual swaps with schools in other countries, either of students or of whole classes.\nThe community has no general rules for the mutual recognition of qualifications at the academic level, although a pilot program, the European Community Course Credit Transfer System, is designed to make it easier for students to move from establishment to establishment.The transfer system is confined to courses in business administration, history, medicine, chemistry and mechanical engineering.\nThe single market does, however, provide for the mutual recognition of professional as opposed to academic qualifications requiring at least three years of third-level education. Next year, this will be extended to all qualifications requiring at least one year of further education.\nBy the time they reach university level, European students will have been subjected to a widely different range of experiences from the kindergarten upward.\nChildren start their schooling at the age of 5 in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and at 6 in the other countries, with the exception of Denmark, where they start at 7 and stay in the same school to the age of 16.\nDifferent countries have different ways of measuring achievements. The United Kingdom and Ireland have different \"streams\" in the same classroom for children of varying abilities. France makes students who fail to come up to standard repeat a year's study. In France, the baccalaurat is a stiff exam awarded by an independent jury. The German and Italian equivalents, the Abitur and the maturit, take into account assessments of the student's work throughout the year. The Spanish bachillerato is awarded on the basis of assessments only. British universities, stressing depth rather than breadth, demand passes in at least three subjects at the advanced level of the General Certificate of Education.\nIn Britain, a public school means a private school, usually expensive. In Mediterranean countries, private means Catholic. France insists on complete separation of church and state in public schools.\nLanguage training varies widely. In Luxembourg, primary school children start with the local language then study alternately in French and German. All education systems worry about better language training, but the English and the Irish are considered to be the community's greatest laggards.\nOne-third of students in German schools follow any one of more than 400 technical courses that lead to apprenticeships and jobs.Such training has a good image in Germany, and schools keep close links with local industry. Elsewhere in Europe, technical training is seen as the slow lane for students who are not well adapted to academic studies.\nIn France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, students with high school qualifications are entitled automatically to a university place, although the easier it is to get into a university, in general, the higher the dropout rate after the first year.\nFrance selects medical students, however, and Spain selects would-be civil engineers. Germany and the Netherlands set limits on entry to several popular courses as well as medical or veterinary studies. Universities in Denmark, Greece, Spain and Portugal select students by examination or high school results. Luxembourg has no university. Britain is the most selective of all, and also has the lowest number of students in higher education.\nLiving costs also vary widely from country to country, as do fees, grants and conditions for obtaining student loans. In practice, those seeking to study abroad are likely to need understanding parents. Under the single market rules, universities are not allowed to charge students coming from other parts of Europe higher fees than their own nationals.\nAccording to Pier Carlo Marchisio of Turin University, writing in the newspaper La Stampa, the single market for education is not likely to get far so long as a Dutch teacher moving to Italy, for example, would earn only one-third as much as at home, while the best Italian professors seek high pay elsewhere.\nBARRY JAMES is on the staff of the International Herald Tribune.",

        "Topic": "1998: The impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton",
        "Title": "U.S. House Votes, 258-176, for Clinton Impeachment Inquiry - The New York Times",
        "Content": "The House of Representatives voted Thursday to open an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton, which makes him only the third president in American history to face such an investigation.\nThe vote was 258 to 176. All but one of the 228 Republicans voted to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to open an investigation that will be unrestricted in time and scope.\nThirty-one of the 206 House Democrats voted along with the Republicans to open the inquiry. The single independent member of Congress, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, joined 175 Democrats in voting against the plan.\nMr. Clinton and his allies could take heart in the relatively small number of defections in his party. Although his personal support among House Democrats is not strong, the number of defectors stayed well below predictions from some analysts that 80 to 100 would desert the president.\nThe White House clearly hopes that the House Judiciary Committee, which will decide at the end of its inquiry whether to forward letters of impeachment to the full House, will pay close heed.\nNonetheless, it had to be a bitter day for a president who was known, during a moment of relative calm earlier in this second term, to be preoccupied with his place in history. His name will now be forever associated with those of President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached but not convicted by the Senate some 130 years ago, and President Richard Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 rather than face likely impeachment by the full House.\nEarlier Thursday, a Democratic proposal that would have set limits on the time and scope of the inquiry was defeated, 236 to 198, mostly on party lines. All but one of the Republicans voting opposed the proposal and all but 10 Democrats supported it.\nThe speaker, Newt Gingrich, who was reprimanded in 1997 for ethics violations and fined $300,000, presided over the House during the vote but did not speak.\nThe votes followed a remarkably wrenching public drama that began Jan. 21 with the revelation of Mr. Clinton's sexual relationship with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, which he for months denied. The relationship, and the denials, became the subject of a dramatic nine-month inquiry by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who last month sent the House a report that said Mr. Clinton had committed 11 potentially impeachable offenses, including perjury, obstruction of justice and tampering with witnesses. A House investigator later decided that there were 15 grounds for impeachment.\nWhite House spokesmen, even while promising to cooperate, continued Thursday to portray the push for an inquiry as being driven by Mr. Clinton's political enemies.\n\"Up till now this process has been infected with politics,\" said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. \"Just everywhere you look you see it.\"\nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois, and others asserted that the inquiry would be as expeditious as possible.\nYet, as many Democrats warned, there was no certainty that the inquiry will not last well into the new year.\nRepresentative Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, said that a protracted inquiry \"will hurt our country and our people and our children.\"\n\"This investigation must be ended fairly and quickly,\" he asserted.\nDemocrats in particular faced an uncomfortable choice. Many of them, particularly those in conservative or swing districts, feared that a vote against the Republican proposal would haunt them in congressional elections Nov. 3. And, while leaders of both parties cast the vote as one of principle, a difficult range of principles was involved  not only legal and constitutional ones, but also personal and moral ones.\nCongress adjourns this weekend, possibly for the year. A Judiciary Committee subcommittee will meet during the recess, on Oct. 23, to examine what matters constitute impeachable behavior. But it is not clear how the process will continue later in the year, and whether it will be left for the new House convening in January.\nIf the House approves articles of impeachment, the Senate sits as the jury to rule on conviction and removal from office.\nFew novel arguments were heard on the House floor Thursday. During a two-hour debate, Republican speakers unanimously supported the resolution for an unlimited inquiry; Democratic speakers almost unanimously criticized it.\nRepublicans argued that the charges against Mr. Clinton were so grave, his powers so great and his example so important, that to do less than hold a full inquiry would be an affront to the justice system, the constitution and the nation.\nRepresentative James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Washington, said that a vote against the Republican resolution would bring \"a return to the imperial presidency of the Nixon era, where the White House felt that the laws did not apply to them.\"\nDemocrats, while expressing their dismay over Mr. Clinton's actions, insisted that the alleged offenses were not impeachable, that Mr. Starr's investigation had been politically driven, that an extended inquiry could destabilize the country and imperil its vital interests and that the political institutions of the country faced danger of lasting damage.\nSome accused the Republicans of using the impeachment process to remove a president they had not been able to defeat at the ballot box.\nRepresentative David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, said of the Republican resolution: \"It is unfair, it is unlimited and it prolongs this process indefinitely. Under the Republican plan, Congress will spend the next two years mired in hearings, tangled in testimony and grinding its gears in partisan stalemate.\"\nRepresentative Hyde sought to strike a lofty tone in opening the Republicans' side of the hearing by saying, \"Today we will vote on an historic resolution to begin an inquiry into whether the president has committed impeachable offenses.\"\nEvery member, he said, was pulled in different questions \"by many competing forces, but mostly we're moved by our consciences. We must listen to that still, small voice that whispers in our ear, 'Duty, duty, duty.\"'\nThis duty, he added, later in the debate, is \"an onerous, miserable rotten duty, but we have to do it.\"\nRepresentative John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, noted that former President Gerald Ford, a Republican, said recently that the panel should be able to conclude its inquiry before the end of the year. \"I think that we can do it,\" Mr. Conyers added.\n\"Do we want to have prosecutors with unlimited powers, accountable to no one, who will spend millions of dollars investigating a person's sex life- is that the precedent we're setting  who then haul before grand juries every person they've known of the opposite sex?\n\"I beg you not to denigrate this very important process.\"\nMr. Hyde emphasized, as did other Republicans, that the vote was not to impeach but simply to inquire.\n\"We don't make any judgments, we don't make any charges, we simply begin a search for truth,\" Mr. Hyde said.\nRepresentative Robert Wexler, a Democrat of Florida, was loudly applauded by several Democrats when he said: \"The president betrayed his wife. He did not betray the country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference.\"\nBut Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican and a Judiciary Committee member, replied that \"the issue is not sex.\"\nThe issue, he said, is \"Did the president of the United States commit the felony crime of perjury?\"",
