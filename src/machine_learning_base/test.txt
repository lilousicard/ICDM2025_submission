Ronald Wilson Reagan, riding a tide of economic discontent against Jimmy Carter and promising ‘‘to put America back to work again,” was elected the nation’s 40th President yesterday with a sweep of surprising victories in the East, South and the crucial battlegrounds of the Middle West.

At 69 years of age, the former California Governor became the oldest person ever elected to the White House. He built a stunning electoral landslide by taking away Mr. Carter’s Southern base, smashing his expected strength in the East, and taking command of the Middle West, which both sides had designated as the main testing ground. The entire West was his, as expected.

Mr. Carter, who labored hard for a comeback re-election victory similar to that of Harry S. Truman in 1948, instead became the first elected incumbent President since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to go down to defeat at the polls.

Concession by Carter

Despite pre-election polls that had forecast a fairly close election, the rout was so pervasive and so quickly apparent that Mr. Carter made the earliest concession statement of a major Presidential candidate since 1904 when Alton B. Parker bowed to Theodore Roosevelt.

At 9:50 P.M., Mr. Carter appeared with his wife, Rosalynn, before supporters at the ballroom of the Sheraton Washington Hotel and disclosed that an hour earlier he had telephoned Mr. Reagan to concede and to pledge cooperation for the transition to new leadership.

“The people of the United States have made their choice and, of course, I accept that decision,” he said. “I can’t stand here tonight and say it doesn’t hurt.”

At a celebration in the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, Mr. Reagan claimed his victory and said: ‘‘There’s never been a more humbling moment in my life. I give you my sacred oath that I will do my utmost to justify your faith."

With 73 percent of the popular vote counted, Mr. Reagan had 31,404,169 votes, or 50 percent, to 26,295,331, or 42 percent, for Mr. Carter, with John B. Anderson, the independent, drawing 3,862,679, or 6 percent of the national total.

Mr. Reagan also suggested that enough Congressional candidates might ride the coattails of his broad sweep to give Republicans a chance to “have control of one house of Congress for the first time in a quarter of a century.’’’

The Republicans picked up Senateseats in New Hampshire, Indiana, Washington, Iowa, Alabama, Florida and South Dakota and were leading in Idaho. Going into the election, the Senate had 58Democrats, 41 Republicans and one independent. The Republicans also appeared likely to gain at least 20 seats in theHouse, nowhere nearly enough to dislodge the Democratic majority.

In the Presidential race, Mr. Carter managed six victories — in Georgia, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota and the District of Columbia — for 45 electoral votes. But everywhere else the news was bad for him. By early this morning, Mr. Reagan had won 39 states with 444 electoral votes, and more were leaning his way.

In the South, the states of Texas, Flor ida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia,South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky fell to the Reagan forces, an almost total rejection of thePresident by his home region. In the Middle West, the former California Governor took Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, three states on which Mr. Carter had pinned heavy hopes, as well as most others.

But Mr. Reagan’s showing was even more startling in the East. He took New York and Pennsylvania, always vitalbases for Democrats, as well as New Jersey, Connecticut and several smaller States.

A New York Times/CBS News poll of more than 10,000 voters as they left the polls indicated that the predominant motivation among voters was the conviction that it was time for a change. The biggest issue in their minds was the nation’s economy, especially inflation.

‘The Iranian thing reminded people of all their frustration,’’ Robert S. Strauss, the Carter campaign chairman said. ‘They just poured down on him. I don’t think there’s anything anyone could have done differently.”

“It was really a referendum on leadership,” countered Richard Wirthlin, the Reagan pollster. ‘“‘The Presidential debate did not have a tremendous influence on the vote, but it strengthened Reagan’s credibility for taking Carter on as sharply as we did in the last five days and drive home the attack on the economy.”’

The Times /CBS News survey revealed a general collapse of the traditional coalition that has elected Democratic Presidents since the New Deal. It showed Mr.Carter running behind his 1976 performance not only in the South but also among such groups as blue-collar workers, Roman Catholics and Jews.

Pocketbook Issues Stressed

Although the President had tried to make foreign policy, especially nuclear arms control, the principal issue of the election, voters leaving the polls told interviewers that pocketbook issues had been more decisive in their voting. Thirty-five percent of those interviewed said their family financial situation was worse than a year ago, and in that group, Mr. Reagan led the President by 65 to 25 percent.

That kind of voting pattern was particularly damaging to the President in such crucial battlegrounds as Pennsylvania,Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. The dimensions of his defeat carried a number of other Democratic incumbents down with him, including prominent liberal senators like Birch Bayh of Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota, as well as the House Democratic whip, John Brademas of Indiana.

In addition to the Presidency, 34 Senate seats, 13 governorships, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and about 7,500 seats in state legislatures were at stake in the election.

G.0.P. Hopes in Senate

Riding Mr. Reagan’s coattails, Republican candidates for Congress seemed likely to exceed their advance expectations of picking up 15 to 20 seats and half a dozen in the Senate.

Nationwide, Mr. Reagan’s overall margin was greater than Mr. Anderson’s vote and his sweep So extensive that he largely put to rest the Carter contentions that the Illinois Congressman was ‘‘the spoiler”depriving the President of winning margins in key states.

Mr. Anderson made his concession statement at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Washington, about an hour after thePresident spoke, asserting that his campaign had contributed ‘‘a new realism’’ to American politics. His vote total seemed to guarantee him Federal subsidies to help repay his campaign debts. He needed a minimum of 5 percent of the vote to qualify for Federal funds.

All the indications were that Mr. Rea gan’s solid year of active campaigning had put to rest voter worries about his age.

As expected, he was the solid favorite of men, holding close to a 5-to-3 advantage over Mr. Carter in that group, according to the Times / CBS News Poll. Despite earlier indications that the Californian might be penalized among women by his opposition to the equal rights amendment, he managed to run even with the President in that group. That was the only demographic category in which Mr. Carter ran even with his challenger. ,

The mood of the two men, as they voted, reflected their advance estimates of the balloting. Mr. Carter had been given a pessimistic overnight report by his polyester, Patrick H. Caddell, who cautioned that this year there had not been the kind of election-eve surge that lifted the former Governor of Georgia to victory in 1976.

Carter Pledge in Plains

Mr. Carter, his voice breaking and tears welling in his eyes, told well -wishers in his hometown of Plains, Ga., ‘I will not disappoint you.’’ Some in the small crowd were crying.

“I've tried to honor my commitment,”he went on, but he had to pause for a moment to regain self-control, ‘to you.”

“God bless you,’ he said in conclusion.

Mr. Reagan, who has been jaunty and joking over the last several days as aides reported firm momentum since the Presidential debate on Oct. 28, voted at a neighbor’s house near his home at Pacific Palisades, outside Los Angeles.

When reporters asked if he expected to win, Mr. Reagan replied: ‘“You know me. I’m too superstitious to answer anything like that.” But his wife, Nancy, nudged

him and whispered, ‘‘cautiously optimistic,” and he echoed, ‘‘Yes, I’m cautiously optimistic.”’

The Carter camp had pinned its final hopes on a big voter turnout and a break through in the Iranian hostage crisis, but Mr. Caddell said the Iranian situation had worked against the President in the last 48 hours.

Assessments of Outcome

His analysis was that after the debate, the President had fallen 5 percentage points behind Mr. Reagan but recovered by last Saturday night. On Sunday, Mr. Caddell said, Mr. Carter was once again down 5 points and 10 points behind byMonday. “It was all related to the hostages and events overseas,”’ he said.

But the Republican pollster, Mr. Wirth lin, differed, saying that the President’s credibility had been damaged and Mr.Reagan’s strengthened in the debate, laying the basis for the final Republican attacks on Mr. Carter’s economic record.His own polling showed a mounting Reagan lead since the day after the debate, he said.

Mr. Wirthlin also attributed the unexpectedly large Republican margins in state after state to extremely effective organizations that got out a heavy vote and to the collapse of the Democratic Coalition. ‘‘We cracked the unions, blue collar voters, ethnics, Catholics and the South, just as he had planned,”’ he said.

In the Northeast, Middle Atlantic States and coastal regions of the South, there were showers through much of the day, but most of the country had clear weather, cool in the Northern states and warm and pleasant in the South and Southwest.

Voting officials in major states like New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Florida reported long lines and fairly heavy balloting early in the day. In Columbus, Ohio, polling officials had to add extra voting machines to handle the crowds.

Most experts had been expecting turnout to fall below the 54 percent of the eligible voters who cast ballots in 1976. Census estimates placed the number of eligible voters at 160,491,000 and the likely turnout at not more than 88 million.
Appeal to Anderson Backers

Low turnout and Mr. Anderson's pull among potential Democratic voters were major worries for Mr. Carter. With a low turnout, Mr. Carter kept warning, “We Democrats can beat ourselves.”’

“Don’t waste your vote,’’ he pleaded to Anderson supporters in a voice raspy from dawn-till-dusk campaigning in the homestretch drive.

For the President, the election year has been an unpredictable roller-coaster. A year ago, before the American Embassy was seized in Teheran, he looked as though he was headed toward almost certain defeat and might not even be renominated. But after the American hostages were taken, patriotic support rallied to him, and he overtook his main Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, in the polls and took an unbeatable lead in the primaries.

In mid-summer he was once again far behind, this time trailing Mr. Reagan in the polls by 20 points. But when Senator Kennedy healed the Democratic rift and began vigorously campaigning for the Carter-Mondale ticket, Democratic voters began ‘‘coming home” and the polls see-sawed until the debate.

When surveys showed Mr. Reagangaining from their confrontation in Cleveland, the President stepped up the frantic pace of his campaigning. But there was too much ground for him to cover. He had to divide time between fighting for the battleground states of the industrial belt from New Jersey to Wisconsin and protecting his crumbling southern base in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina.

The strain began to show in the final week. ‘I need you," Mr. Carter kept telling his rallies trying to energize a vigorous push from blacks, Hispanic-Americans and other traditionally Democratic voting groups. His right hand was red and bruised from endless hand-shaking and his face, puffy and lined from the relentless pace he had set.

At the same time, Mr. Reagan concentrated his efforts on the pivotal states,bolstered by increasingly confident projections from his own pollsters.
